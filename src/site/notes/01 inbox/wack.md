- felix's heart resides outside of his body, within violet
- violet, being more flesh than chaos, is the one able to stretch and manipulate her body proportions (think unit 02 beast mode or bloodhound knights) once her suit is jailbroken
	- felix can only do it when dangerously overloaded on ln, because he is more chaos than flesh. his usual mode is becoming a big shadow wolfie (a la [e10](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Eden%27s_Promise:_Litany), the shadowkeeper)
- opal lives outside battery city, cid lives with her as an emissary of the brotherhood and as her personal recorder on behalf of the brotherhood. 
	- opal may be a distant relation of felix? (explaining how cid and felix know each other) 
		- or we stick with felix having done a job for cid and thats how they know each other.
- a person who is (equally? in any ratio? dunno) chaos, flesh, and pattern is this universe's *kwisatz haderach*. i dont think its violet or felix
