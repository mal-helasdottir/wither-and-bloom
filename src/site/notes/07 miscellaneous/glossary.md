**caffe** - the receptacle for daily servings of **feen**. meant to keep the drink at its appropriate temperature for the time of day. bastardized from the modern *carafe*. not necessarily a *mug*-like object but frequently is such.

## q
## r
**red, the** - a blood mist common in the wastes, thicker around the presence of the flesh. literally made of blood. it is a factor in triggering the subtle madness amongst the populace, but no more than a gentle nudge (lack of empathy, tendency to violence, etc. the groupthink is just human nature though). exposure increases the chances of demoniac possession, like how exposure to rads begets higher incidences of cancer over time.

## v
## w
**wyrmwind** - the slow moving ground-hugging cloud of chlorine gas that tends to form in the wastes under certain weather conditions. it is highly toxic to all biological tissue and can kill (painfully) in mere seconds. doesn't *need* to be inhaled to kill, but it certainly works faster if you do. akin to the shrinking death wall in battlegrounds style video games.
