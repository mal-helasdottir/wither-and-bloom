## geography

---

the habitable world has shrunk considerably since [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]]. what remains is divided roughly into zones based on survivability rather than old political borders.

### the western wilds

- the primary setting of the story. stretches from the rocky mountains to the pacific coast, from the northern reaches of old canada down through mexico.
- dotted with [[05 places/the demonwastes\|demonfields]]—patches of land transformed by [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] where the atmosphere itself has shifted to favor demons over humans. green skies. chlorine storms. flesh-twisted flora and fauna.
- between the demonfields: irradiated desert, scrubland, and the occasional stretch of something approaching normal. this is where the [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|empire's]] franchises sit, where [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]'s tunnels run, where waster settlements scratch out survival.
- traversable with preparation. deadly without it. but people live here. people have always lived here.

### the drowned east

- everything east of the appalachians is gone.
- the bombs fell on every major city. new york. boston. philadelphia. washington. atlanta. miami. the strikes shattered infrastructure that was already failing—seawalls, pumping stations, drainage systems that had been holding back rising oceans for decades.
- without maintenance, the atlantic rushed in. what the nukes didn't flatten, the water claimed. what the water didn't claim, the radiation poisoned.
- four hundred years later, the eastern seaboard is a flooded ruin. drowned skyscrapers jutting from irradiated shallows. the bones of highways disappearing into murky water. entire cities reduced to artificial reefs too hot to touch.
- some higher ground remains—the appalachian spine, fragments of the piedmont—but it's isolated, inaccessible, and by all accounts not worth the trip.

### the middle ground

- the great plains, the midwest, the area between the rockies and the appalachians.
- less flooded than the east, less demon-infested than the west. also less... anything. the breadbasket of old america is now a windswept expanse of abandoned farms, collapsed towns, and endless nothing.
- [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]'s tunnel network extends through here, connecting cave systems from texas to kentucky. this is how mutants move through territory that would kill them on the surface.
- scattered waster settlements exist, but they're sparse. not enough resources to fight over. not enough shelter to settle in. people pass through. people don't stay.

## what do people know?

---

### the empire

- corpo citizens know what the empire tells them, which is almost nothing.
- official curriculum doesn't acknowledge the old world in detail. history begins with [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]]. geography begins with zion. everything else is "the wilds"—a vague, threatening outside that exists only to make citizens grateful for the walls.
- if the drowned east is mentioned at all, it's in religious terms. the sinful cities. the wicked who were punished. sodom and gomorrah made literal. a cautionary tale about what happens to those who lived outside the CEO's grace.
- more practically: "eastern reclamation projects" occasionally appear in workforce allocation reports. voluntary transfers. good pay. no one comes back to complain about the conditions.
- the most effective propaganda is silence. kids born in zion have no reason to know new york ever existed. you can't miss what you never knew was there.

### mutants

- mutants know the practical truth.
- the east floods. the water's hot—not temperature hot, radiation hot. any settlement out there needs pump systems running constantly or it's underwater within a season. you can commandeer old pumps from ruins if you can find them, if they still work, if you can get them running on something other than LN.
- some mutant traders have gone east. some have even come back. the reports are consistent: not worth it. too much water, too much rad, not enough salvage to justify the trip. the good stuff got picked over centuries ago or sank too deep to reach.
- battery city's easternmost tunnels are sealed for a reason. not because there's anything dangerous down there—just nothing worth opening them for.

### wasters

- wasters know the economic truth.
- going east means crossing the middle ground—weeks of travel through nothing, burning fuel and supplies for zero guarantee of return. then you hit the flood zone, where you need boats, rad gear, and a death wish.
- the equation doesn't work. risk versus reward. the west has demonfields, sure, but demonfields have demon parts, and demon parts have value. the east has irradiated seawater and the skeletons of buildings no one remembers the names of.
- other wasters have gone east. other wasters haven't come back. maybe they found something good and decided to keep it. maybe they're dead. either way, there's no cash in finding out.
