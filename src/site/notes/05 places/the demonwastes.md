# the demonwastes

## limbo
*location*: outside austin, texas ([[05 places/the most holy city of imperial zion\|city of zion]])
*dante's version*: hell's waiting room consisting of two parts
				- vestibule, just inside the gates where any who stood aside and allowed evil to happen are doomed to forever chase a mirage
				- the citadel, where unbaptized infants and virtuous pagans who lived before the birth of christ dwell until the judgment day, when they will be redeemed (possibly)
*our vibe*: somewhere everyone has to wait for an indeterminate amount of time at least once in their lives: a doctor's office, a moving elevator, a theme park ride queue, a moving sidewalk, the dmv, that bakery in seinfeld with the chocolate babka. the demon answer to taking a ticket and waiting to be served... except it will never happen.
