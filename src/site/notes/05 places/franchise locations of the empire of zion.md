*zion's military industrial complex*

> *Joshua 6:1-27* relates the israelite capture of this city from their canaanite neighbors, the first victory on the road to establishing a kingdom of israel.

## cana
*voted zion's number one getaway for a century running!*
- corpo's idea of a fabulous resort: lots of sand and sun and tourist traps
- nice but artificial and kinda chintzy--like a cruise ship stop

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - the site of jesus christ's first miracle, wherein he turned water into wine and saved a wedding from being kind of shit. legend has it that mary, his mom, specifically requested he do this so the bride and groom did not commit a party foul
> - *John 2* contains the details

## nazareth
*the home of zion's syndicated entertainment and official communication networks*
- the propaganda machine is headquartered here

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - primarily known as jesus's childhood hometown. jesus is frequently referred to as *Jesus of Nazareth* or as a *nazarene*

## bethlehem
*the birthplace of kings*
- thought to be the birthplace of the ceo
- a quiet, sleepy almost suburb by corpo standards though it is maintained to a rigorous standard for nostalgia purposes and no other reason. consider it a living history museum featuring heavily sanitized retellings and reenactments of major moments from the life of the ceo and his disciples

## magdala
*zion's amsterdam*
**THOUGHTS**:
- mary has associations with fine ointments and perfumes, women in general, apothecaries, hairdressers, converts, pharmacists, sexual temptation, and penitent sinners
- mary was considered the lead female follower as simon peter was for male followers. i like the idea of magdala and [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#capernaum\|capernaum]] (peter's birthplace) having a rivalry due to competing industries 
- "magdalena" is a perfect circle [[02 history/the playlist\|song]] about being romantically obsessed with an exotic dancer
- i believe the garden where violet was grown and decanted is the garden closest to magdala, hence her full moniker "*violet of magdala*".

> [!INFO]- bible reference
