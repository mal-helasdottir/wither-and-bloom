- forges can't be made from metal
- fuel is either too hot or not hot enough

- must be coated (likely in [[06 concepts/liquid dark\|LD10097d]], though less common more ersatz/mutie methods are sometimes used) to ensure *extra* longevity outside the [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]] megalopolis
