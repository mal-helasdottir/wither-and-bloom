# the gardens
the facilities where the experiments of [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|the prodigy project]] take place 

more biobeast than structure. in a very real way the prodigy candidates are the offspring of their initial garden and the ceo. imagine the **god warriors** [^1] from nausicaa of the valley of the wind, their skeletons laying wherever they fell--but the meat stayed on and experimentational facilities were built inside.
