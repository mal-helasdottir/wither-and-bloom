# [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]
*home of the mutant resistance*

## history
---
- at the time of [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]] many groups were unable to secure protection within corpo controlled cities.
	- poor, homeless, jobless, disabled, etc.
	- poc, lgbtqia+, etc.
	- those with uncertain citizenship status like immigrants, refugees, etc.
- the survivors of these various groups have gone on to found various towns, economies, and criminal networks out in the wastes
	- see: [[05 places/Frontier and Mute Towns\|Frontier and Mute Towns]]

- battery city was founded by a group of aforementioned undesirables who sought shelter from the bombs in cave systems. pollution accelerated cave expansion, linking systems together and allowing cultural exchange, mutual protection, and networking
- mutation begins and not long after the restoration, zion begins attempts to systematically exterminate those with mutations who lives outside the empire's authority
## geography
---
- a sprawling irradiated cave system that seems to expand exponentially as time passes (acid pollution in the water cycle has accelerated the processes by which caves are made)
	- includes the mammoth caves system in kentucky, ozark caverns (missouri), carlsbad caverns in new mexico, caves in texas, tennessee, the dakotas, mexico (because what even are borders at this point?), etc.
	- includes several sufficiently deep and braced commercial mines that have been connected, either naturally or artificially
- contains several giant reasonably pure aquifers and underground river systems, water having left its acids in the stone on the way down (making the caves bigger)(think the fremen of arrakis)
- deep, stable areas feature many many many mushrooms and lichens of all colors, shapes, and sizes. they often glow. most are edible. some have hallucinogenic properties.
