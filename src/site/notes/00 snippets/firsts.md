**battery city, feast of the all-martyr's**
*violet*

there's something about him, she thinks, for what must be the twentieth time just today.

something special.

something... she's staring, and he notices. locks eyes with her across the small crowd and the powdery rainbow clouds. he's covered in the colorful particles, they cling to him with a ghostly reverence, as if he's one of the martyred ancestors this entire celebration is for. the idea of fel being martyred hurts somehow, brings a burn to her eyes and pulls the corners of her mouth down.

always the contrarian, fel grins, widening slowly, growing brighter, like daybreak over the wastes. his fangs glitter in battery city's perpetual twilight, and his eyes are dark and deep, fixed on her.

always on her. she can't look away.

he strides over, still grinning in that sly, smug way of his, but she swears she can hear a too-fast pulse beneath the pink spattered cloth of his shirt, beneath the cage of his ribs. though perhaps she's simply hearing her own pulse. it's difficult to say. it's hard to focus. she can smell him too, snowfall and sweat and the LN he coats all his equipment with.

"vi," he says.

"fel," she replies.

"ya need somethin'?" impossibly, his expression becomes smarmier and her stomach does a flopping dance of betrayal. "ya awful clean... i can help with that."

before she can ask what he means, he lobs a hidden handful of bright blue dust in her face and *runs*.
