# Kal

A corpo security officer stationed in Jericho's mute district. One of the rare "good cops" in the [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|Holy Corporate Empire of Zion]].

## Identity

- **Species**: Human (corpo)
- **Family**: Noble/wealthy corpo family; Kal is the black sheep
- **Status**: Thrust into military service to hide him away / "bust him out of his bad ways"

## Occupation

- Corp security officer assigned to the mute district
- Dead-end posting — punishment for causing trouble with superiors
- Only reason he hasn't been shipped to some frontier franchise is his family name

## Personality & Dynamics

- Wanted to be a hero, became a cop, realized how corrupt the system is
- Stays in security specifically to protect as many mutants as he can on the sly

- She has feelings for him too (may not fully realize it yet)
- They eventually flee Jericho together

### [[03 people/felix\|Felix]]
- Felix lets him think he's still paying for Polly's services
- Kal: "die? just die."
- Felix answers the door at Polly's shirtless and mussed just to fuck with him

## Role in the Narrative

- The Oskar Schindler figure
- Helps smuggle things / look the other way for mutes in the district
- When things escalate (possibly a district cull), he defects
- Saves a bunch of mutes in the process
- Flees with Polly and other refugees to [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]] or another frontier town
