## the gods 
### [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the flesh]]
- *body*, mother mother
	- the way the flesh is offered up and consumed by lesser beings after her power, [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s mirroring of these actions as he creates minions, the cannibalistic nature of [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and devils and a little tongue and cheek reference to catholic eucharist. t
- *vore*, sleep token
### [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the pattern]]
- *starman*, david bowie
	- extremely innocent take on the infinite pattern, making her seem gentle, interested, positive, etc. she's not any of those things but *let the children boogie*, as they say. t
- *hypnosis*, sleep token
- *algorithm*, muse
### the diminished
- *aspiring fires*, mother mother
	- fire - chaotic, ravenous, uncontrollable, viral, nonsensical. *you wanna see me crazy? well i'll show you it's like and then i'll wave goodbye as you run for your life*. *a little advice for aspiring fires: you get put out if you don't get a little wild*. *because crazy in the box is everything that crazy's not*. t
- *string break song*, charming disaster
	- there is no living without destruction. nothing lasts forever. every day takes you one more closer to the last. *chaos is gonna win in the end, the universe is flying apart, there ain't nothing much you can do about it. burn up the candle or live in the dark*? t
- *alkaline*, sleep token
- *black sheep* metric
	- our common goal was waiting for the world to end, now the truth is just a rule that you can bend, you crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again.  *changing the rules and changing their shape helps everyone and no one, chaos is also very much THE black sheep of the gods, the diminished half doubly so*
