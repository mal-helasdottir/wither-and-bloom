# don't get hurt >> feelings almost come out, a vibe check
#snippet #waifu 

"I can’t afford to let you… get hurt!" 

The awkward pause speaks volumes to her. "Can’t afford—afford?" Her little fist connects with his chest surprisingly hard. "Fuck you. Fuck you!"

"Vee—"

"No go fuck yourself. All you care about, all you’ve ever cared about, is getting paid. Well, I don’t give a fuck about your fucking bolts, Felix." Color swirls in the bottomless depths of her black eye as she trembles, her whole body tense as a coiled spring.

He closes the distance with one long stride and tilts her chin up with forefinger and thumb. Tears like diamonds slip from her eyes as he slants his mouth over hers.

She tastes so good, even better than last time, he can’t help but groan, slipping his tongue in beside hers to drink deep. It’s soft, so soft as it dances across the ridges of his own. Her trembling won’t stop so he pulls her close, giving her his heat, threading one hand in her braid and placing the other on the curve of her ass. 

More softness. More sweetness.

He kisses her harder, trying to wipe the consequences of a close range hit from one of those creatures from his mind. She would be dead, but she isn’t. She’s alive.

He’d have to send some bolts Cids way. The monk said he’d pray for them and Felix is eternally grateful he’d accepted the offer in silence.

She’s alive.

*Get a grip felix everything is fine.*

He’d give her more than kisses and heat if she asked. He’d give her everything he had and anything he’d get. Whatever she wanted, he’d make it hers.

Sighing she ends the kiss, stepping away and leaving him cold and aching. "What was that for Felix?"

"You was—" he stops and clears his throat, trying to keep the low rasp of desire from creeping in. "You was crying. And it ain’t about the bolts. This—" he gestures to indicate the pair of them "ain’t about bolts or creds."

"What do you mean?" She’s playing with fire and she knows it. He’s equally likely to give her a world shattering truth as he is to make a joke, but she needs the truth this time. 

It’s worth the risk.

The wet streaks on her face have attracted blood dust, which is doubtless stinging like a motherfucker. Her eyes are angry, dry red and her perfect lips are swollen from his kisses.

"Felix?"

He can’t lie to her, not now, maybe not ever. "If you die, I’m gonna die. I’m gonna walk into the wastes and pick a fight with the ugliest demon I can find, and I’m gonna keep fighting until I’m dead too."
