# the board
[[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s original fanboys
his closest confidants
the leaders and progenitors of the great houses of [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|imperial zion]]
closest to the ceo in age and power, but without being puppeted by [[04 groups/the eldest ones#the fallen flesh\|an elder god]]
