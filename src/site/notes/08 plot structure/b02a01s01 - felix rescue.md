# ðŸ“¦ Operation: Annex Breach (Felix Rescue Flashback)

A chapter chronicling [[03 people/violet\|violet]] and the resistance launching an assault on a corpo black site to retrieve [[03 people/felix\|felix]]. 

---

## Setting

- **Location**: Unnamed corpo black site, internally dubbed *The Annex*
  - Situated away from [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]
  - Likely subterranean or heavily shielded
  - Built to contain and study bio-assets

- **Purpose**:
  - Holding facility for experimentation on valuable biological subjects
  - Secure enough to host [[03 people/rose\|rose]] (or be under her direct command)
  - Features surgical theaters, vaults, and isolation cells

- **Security**:
  - High-level corpo clearance
  - Guarded by **true siblings** â€” surviving [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|prodigy]] candidates trained in other [[05 places/the gardens\|gardens]] or loyal to corpo command
  - Their training mirrors Violetâ€™s own. Some might recognize her. Others attack on sight.

## Characters Involved

- **Violet**: Field leader of the rescue
  - Still recovering from Battery City
  - Cloned eye currently indistinguishable from her original, though it's turning darker
  - She has not yet bloomed again
- **Roz**: Present and alert, riding in Winne or at Violet's side
  - Roz behaves normally â€” protective, watchful
- **Resistance Squad**: 
  - At least 2â€“3 fighters (canon names TBD)
  - A sniper, a breaker, and a scout maybe?
- **Felix**: Being held deep inside the facility
  - Maimed, conscious, furious
  - Still alive â€” but barely
- **Rose**: Possibly present in person, or arriving during/after breach

## Beat-by-Beat Breakdown

- **â€¢ Violet's Arrival**:
  - Violet rides in on a resistance transport or stripped-down utility crawler
  - She brings Roz and a few trusted resistance members
  - Sheâ€™s cold, clipped â€” all her energy focused on one goal

- **â€¢ The Breach**:
  - Tech team disables cameras and interior locks
  - Squad moves through outer corridors â€” sterile white, too quiet
  - Evidence of others: blood, discarded syringes, shattered restraints
  - They encounter **true siblings** â€” former Garden candidates twisted by corpo doctrine
  - Their movements are clean, silent, and cruel.

- **â€¢ Finding Him**:
  - Felix is located in a surgical containment wing
  - Heâ€™s **restrained**, **awake**, and **in pain**
  - Missing his **left arm**
  - Surgical incisions suggest samples have been taken â€” his **torso is stapled shut**
  - His skin is pallid from blood loss, exhaustion, and repeated regen

- **â€¢ The Hug**:
  - Violet enters the room without a word
  - Felix sees her. Thinks heâ€™s hallucinating. Tries to speak â€” chokes on it
  - She **drops everything and launches herself at him**
  - Arms around his neck. Legs around his waist. Her head buried against his throat
  - He can't lift his remaining arm right. But he leans into her like itâ€™s a lifeline
  - No names. No questions. Just breath and contact

- **â€¢ Extraction**:
  - Resistance team removes him from the rig
  - Roz helps sever a restraint cable with her teeth
  - Violet wraps him in one of his own shirts from Winne â€” too large, too soft
  - They torch the lab on the way out
  - May or may not fight their way back through closing gates

- **â€¢ Aftermath**:
  - They retreat back to Winne or a forward camp
  - Felix sleeps. When he wakes, he thinks it was a dream
  - Violet hasn't left his side
  - Roz sleeps on his chest. He looks at his stump. Quiet. Then closes his eyes again

- Resistance uses the broadcast location to find the Annex
- They recover partial data from the lab â€” potential clues about Rose's next move
