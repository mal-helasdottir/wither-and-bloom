1. biblically foretold
2. miraculous

## the world before
- By the late 21st century, climate change had already reshaped the map. Rising sea levels swallowed coastlines worldwide. The eastern seaboard of the former United States existed in a state of managed crisis—seawalls, pump systems, and constant maintenance holding back the Atlantic from cities that should have drowned decades prior.
- Global infrastructure strained under the weight of climate refugees, resource wars, and the slow-motion collapse of coastal economies.
- The discovery of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] in the Gulf of Mexico and the subsequent development of LN (living network) technology offered a temporary reprieve—a new energy source that seemed infinite and renewable. The corporation that would become [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|the corporate fellowship]] rose to prominence on the back of this discovery.
- Humanity had become dependent on LN technology. Power grids, transportation, medicine, manufacturing—all of it ran on the Flesh.

## the nuclear strikes
- The Anunnaki's contingency plan was not surgical. It was extinction-level.
	- Orbital nuclear strikes targeted every major population center on the planet. New York. Los Angeles. Tokyo. London. Beijing. Mumbai. São Paulo. Cairo. Every city of significance was marked for death.
	- The strikes on the Gulf of Mexico were meant to destroy [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]'s remains. They failed.
	- The strikes on Austin were meant to kill [[03 people/the ceo\|the CEO]]. The meat dome closed first.
- The eastern seaboard, already drowning before the bombs fell, ceased to exist as habitable land.
	- Nuclear strikes shattered what infrastructure remained.
	- Without constant maintenance, the seawalls failed. The Atlantic rushed in.
	- What the bombs didn't kill, the water claimed. What the water didn't claim, the radiation poisoned.
	- Within a decade, everything east of the Appalachians was either underwater, irradiated beyond survival, or both.
- The global death toll was incalculable. Billions died in the initial strikes. Billions more in the aftermath—starvation, radiation sickness, the collapse of supply chains, the wars that followed.
- The western United States survived in patches. Inland. Higher elevation. Far enough from primary targets to avoid immediate vaporization, close enough to catch the fallout.
	- This is where [[05 places/the demonwastes\|the Demonfields]] spread—the Flesh flung from the CEO's body during his failed apotheosis found purchase in irradiated soil.
	- This is where the survivors crawled out of the rubble.
	- This is where the empire would rise.
