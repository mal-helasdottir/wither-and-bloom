- ???? - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] begins its long slumber in the depths of far space to recover and prepare for [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Fleshwarper]]’s inevitable return.
- ~3.7 billion years ago (BYA) - A part of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] impacts with earth. It is a skull fragment featuring a myriad of eye sockets.
	- Life starts to appear shortly after this. A forest eventually forms around the skull fragment.  Most fauna instinctively avoided the skull.
- ~2.6 BYA - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] briefly rouses to establish watch points throughout the universes near locations parts of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] has landed. His followers are to keep vigil as it returns to its slumber.

- ~68 million years ago (MYA)- A Carchatodontosaurs in the late Cretaceous period was chasing prey through a dense rainforest when the large theropod stepped on a shard of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]’s skull bone.  A fragment became lodged int he creatures foot which grew infected. By the time it died most of its skin had turned black and it had grown several extra eyes.

- ~2.8 MYA - One half of the Sundered Chaos, who will eventually become known as [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Diminished One]] reaches earth.
	- The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] mark [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Diminished One]]’s arrival, but their directive is related to that of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]] and so they only observe it and do not interfere or disturb [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the pattern]] about it.
	- The Homo Habilis makes its first appearance around this time.
