## üß¨ Creation & Experimental Context

- Violet was **not born but grown** by the CEO as part of a divine interface program. Her creation was part of a second wave of **Prodigies** meant to serve as vessels for divine energy (specifically the essence of the **Fallen Flesh**).
- She is considered the **first stable product** of the program, though she is not without flaws from the CEO‚Äôs perspective.
- Her "sister" Rose is a twin in genetic and metaphysical terms, though they ultimately diverge in power, allegiance, and transformation.
- Violet is not merely a vessel. She has **agency**, **independent thought**, and a resistance to full indoctrination by the Pattern or the Flesh.
- Her ability to resist and redirect divine energy is believed to stem from the influence of **Roz**, who bestowed her the capacity for *Wither and Bloom*.

---

## üß† Personality

- Violet is extremely emotionally guarded due to lifelong trauma.
- Prone to withdrawal, hyper-vigilance, and self-effacement in moments of vulnerability.
- Displays autistic-coded behaviors: sensory sensitivity, low eye contact, extreme pattern recognition, internal moral logic system.
- Her sarcasm, occasional coldness, or deadpan delivery often masks extreme compassion and guilt.
- Her wit can be razor sharp, but never cruel to those she loves.

## üåÄ Powers & Divine Mechanics

### Wither and Bloom (Roz‚Äôs Gift)
- Violet can **drain** energy from the living (Wither) and **release** it into others or the world (Bloom).
- This gift is **not derived from the Flesh** or Pattern but is instead Roz‚Äôs personal intervention‚Äîintended or not, given as an act of chaos, resistance, or curiosity.
- She must **touch** to activate either side of the ability. Internal energy can be stored but becomes volatile if unbalanced.
- Withering is destructive, fast, and draining.
- Blooming is restorative, often emotional, and difficult for her at first.
- Only later does she discover she can Bloom others‚Äînot just herself‚Äîand this changes her relationship to power entirely.

### Other Traits
- Exceptional stealth, combat efficiency, and environmental adaptability.
- Immune to many effects that warp or corrupt humans (due to her origin and possible Roz-granted immunity).
- Has a latent bond to Roz that may allow subtle or unconscious magical resistance to the Pattern‚Äôs recursive influence.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Key Relationships

### Felix of Jericho
- Her equal, her contrast, her opposite, her partner.
- They start as strangers in a warzone and end as twin orbiting stars‚Äîalways pulled toward one another.
- He is the **first person to treat Violet‚Äôs body as *hers***‚Äînot as property, not as a weapon, not as a sacred object.
- Their sexual relationship is tender, reverent, and *feral in worshipful ways*.
- Felix sees Violet‚Äôs pain and never flinches. He holds her while she breaks and never asks her to be anything other than what she is.
- He is not afraid of her power‚Äîhe is in love with her because of it.

### Roz
- Roz protects her‚Äînot out of benevolence, but amusement and anti-Pattern alignment.
- Gifted her the power of Wither and Bloom, possibly as a joke or test of entropy.
- May see Violet as a favored agent, a walking contradiction, or the final proof that chaos is superior to recursion and flesh.

### Rose
- Twin, mirror, tragedy. Rose did not resist the CEO‚Äôs programming.
- Their fates are entwined by design and sabotage.
- Violet mourns what Rose became, and that grief never fully leaves her.

## üé≠ Symbolic and Thematic Roles

- **Violet is what happens when a god-weapon refuses to kill.**
- She is **the counterpoint to empire**‚Äînot through revolution, but through compassion, survival, tenderness, and refusal.
- Her ability is a metaphor for processing trauma: you *wither*, you *bloom*, and if you‚Äôre lucky, you choose who gets to see you whole.
- Violet is not chosen by fate. She **chooses herself**, again and again.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Notes

- Her immunity to the full effects of LN (Liquid Night) has not yet been explained. It may relate to Roz‚Äôs protection or to an internal metabolizing system built by the CEO‚Äôs researchers.
- Though engineered, Violet is **not soulless**. Her humanity is real, and it is her refusal to become a monster that defines her arc.
- She is the only one known to successfully stabilize both *Wither* and *Bloom* without mutating.
