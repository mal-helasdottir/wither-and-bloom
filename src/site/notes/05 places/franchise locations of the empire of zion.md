## jericho
*zion's military industrial complex*
- walled city securing machines, manpower, and tech for the purposes of wrecking shit both internal and external
- gladiatorial games are a regular occurrence for both entertainment and practice

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> described as "the city of palm trees" and "the oldest fortified city in the world"
> *Joshua 6:1-27* relates the israelite capture of this city from their canaanite neighbors, the first victory on the road to establishing a kingdom of israel.

## cana
*voted zion's number one getaway for a century running!*
- corpo's idea of a fabulous resort: lots of sand and sun and tourist traps
- nice but artificial and kinda chintzy--like a cruise ship stop

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - the site of jesus christ's first miracle, wherein he turned water into wine and saved a wedding from being kind of shit. legend has it that mary specifically requested he do this so the bride and groom did not commit a party foul
> - *John 2* contains the details

## nazareth
*the home of zion's entertainment and communication networks*
- the propaganda machine is headquartered here

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - primarily known as jesus's childhood hometown. jesus is frequently referred to as *Jesus of Nazareth* or as a *nazarene*
> - said to be where the archangel gabriel appeared to mary and announced the impending birth of christ

## bethlehem

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - the birthplace of both king David and Jesus of Nazareth
> - destroyed by emperor hadrian but rebuilt by Constantine the great and then again by justinian I after it was conquered by byzantium
> - Both the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew contain details
> - King Herod killed every boy child of two years or younger here and in the surrounding area in fear of a prophesied king of the jews

## magdala
**THOUGHTS**:
- mary has associations with fine ointments and perfumes, women in general, apothecaries, hairdressers, converts, pharmacists, sexual temptation, and penitent sinners
- mary was considered the lead female follower as simon peter was for male followers. i like the idea of magdala and [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#bethsaida\|bethsaida]] (peter's birthplace) having a rivalry due to competing industries 
- "magdalena" is a perfect circle [[02 history/the playlist\|song]] about being romantically obsessed with an exotic dancer
- industry possibilities
	- education, mary being the only disciple to truly understand Jesus
	- death and burial, her association with penitence, oils, perfumes and her presence during the crucifixion. might be fun for a secret group of the [[04 groups/the brotherhood of gnosis\|brotherhood]] to hang here since everyone else there is dead
	- luxury goods, oils, perfumes, and hairdressing 
	- reeducation from her understanding but also her penitence
	- medicine from her caring for Jesus feet, her own exorcism and possible miracle cure, apothecaries and pharmacists 
- i believe the garden where violet was grown and decanted is the garden closest to magdala, hence her full moniker "*violet of magdala*".

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - the hometown or perhaps birthplace of mary magdalen, possible female apostle, possibly sugar mama, possibly exorcised by jc himself. by tradition a witness to the crucifixion, the burial, the empty tomb, and the resurrected christ
> - a fishing town on the western shore of the sea of galilee
> - by the end of the first century it was renowned for "its inhabitants alleged vice and licentiousness"

## tzipori/zippori/sepphoris

> [!INFO]- bible reference
> - traditionally the birthplace of mary, mother of jesus, and the residence of anna and joachim, her parents (jesus' grandparents). mary comes from a long line of priests from the lineage of Aaron and the Tribe of Levi
> - very close distance wise to nazareth and jesus may have made frequent trips here to do carpentry work
> - *tzipor* is the hebrew word for **bird**
> - famous across galilee for pomegranates, olives, and wheat before everything was replaced with animal feed plants
## capernaum
