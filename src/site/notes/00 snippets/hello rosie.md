# hello rosie >> sneaky rosie is very sneaky and stealing meaty

"’Ey!" he shouts after the coal black beast, though he knows it to be pointless.

She freezes, front paw up as in a prance and the second set of ears turn to him. The other set give nary a swivel.

He scoffs. "Ya think you’re slick, Rosie. But ya ain’t. Bring that on back."

Rosie sets her one paw down then lifts the next, and then twice more, carrying her another foot away from Felix.

The man’s tail twitches, swaying low. His voice likewise drops deep, into a growl that’d make any rational müte think twice.

However the beast is not a müte. Oh she is indeed *mutated* but she’s not like Felix or Ma or Ancient Grundy or anyone else he’s ever met in Battery City. Or outside of it for that matter.

A strange creature Ma found dying in her last few days on the old tops and saved, it hung around, impossible to shake, and when Ma discovered that wild, fierce beast cleaning catcus milk from Felix’s chubby baby chin and fingers just as gentle as you like—as if he was a beast cub?

Well that decided things.

She retired then and there to raise Felix as best she could. 

And Rosie came along every step of the way.

"*Rosie* ya gonna take food from my mouth? Ya gonna do Ma like that?"

She cuts left into a long patch of swill grass, disappearing into cool, silent shadows.

Felix watches the spot for a moment before turning back to his dinner. The roots need a good chopping and fussing with Rosie isn’t getting it done, as the rumbling of his belly reminds him.

Chopping done, he clears the big pile into the firepot then returns to his kitchen to find the meat upon the work surface; immaculate save the four or five rows of evenly spaced punctures from Rosie’s maw.
