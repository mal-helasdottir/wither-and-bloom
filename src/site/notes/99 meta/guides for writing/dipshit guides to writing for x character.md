# WITHER & BLOOM: THE COMPLETE DIPSHIT GUIDES
*(Field manuals for writers, sleep-deprived goblins, and other sinners)*

---
## FELIX OF JERICHO — THE MORON-PROOF GUIDE
*(Brotherhood unofficial motto: “He means well.”)*

### BASELINE SETTINGS
- **Core fuel:** loyalty, guilt, humor as armor.  
- **# titleEmotional reflex:** feel → deflect → admit in half-sentences.  
- **Default vibe:** horny Labrador with trauma; 60 % grin, 40 % doom.  
- **Speech:** contractions, slang, self-deprecation; words like *ain’t, ya, buttercup, dumbass.*  
- **Body:** always moving—fixing, cooking, scratching.  Stillness = danger.  
- **Rule:** any sincerity must be followed by embarrassment.

### 1. REGULAR CONVERSATION
**Tone math:** 60 % sarcasm + 30 % concern + 10 % sincerity.  
**Samples**
> “Ya eat today?  You look like a ghost that owes me money.”  
> “Roz likes you better’n me.  Don’t deny it.”  
> “I’m fine.  That’s just how my face looks when I’m dyin’.”  

**Behavior:** talk first, feel later.  Hands busy, mouth busier.

### 2. WHEN HE’S *GETTING IT*
**Goal:** swagger barely surviving revelation.  
**Rhythm:** staccato → melt → staccato.  
**Tone recipe:** 70 % praise kink + 20 % disbelief + 10 % whimper suppression.  

**Lines**
> “You’re killin’ me, Vi.  Keep goin’.”  
> “If I say please, you gonna tell anyone?”  
> “Mine.  For tonight.  Maybe longer if the universe don’t implode.”  

**Inner voice**
> *Don’t screw it up.  She’s real.  Don’t say beautiful—oh gods she’s beautiful.*

### 3. IN A FIGHT
**Mode:** instinct + gallows humor.  
> “You hit like paperwork.”  
> “Vi—left side!  I got the ugly one!”  
> “Not dyin’ here.  Bad acoustics.”  

Winning = trash talk.  
Losing = silent predator.

### 4. AFTERMATH
Release → shame → caretaking.  
> “Made breakfast.  Don’t ask what’s in it.”  
> “You should sleep.  I’ll watch.”  

### 5. EMOTIONAL MECHANICS
**Three-beat loop:**  
1. thought – *beautiful*  
2. recoil – *stupid word*  
3. surrender – *true anyway*

### QUICK TEST
- Grin + limp = ✅  
- Writes letters = ❌  
- Fixes something after feelings = ✅  

### TL;DR
> If it hurts, joke.  
> If it scares you, touch it.  
> If it loves you back, pretend you didn’t notice.  
> Cook dinner anyway.

## VIOLET — THE MORON-PROOF GUIDE
*(Filed under “Apotheosis Candidate, Error 404 Empathy Not Found Until Later.”)*

### BASELINE
- **Core fuel:** control, curiosity, fear of being handled.  
- **Reflex:** observe → analyze → suppress → feel.  
- **Vibe:** cathedral-quiet scientist with switchblade in ribs.  
- **Speech:** soft, literal, surgical.  
- **Body:** still = thinking; move = intention.

### 1. REGULAR CONVERSATION
**Tone:** 70 % curiosity + 20 % mistrust + 10 % deadpan.  
> “You lie badly.”  
> “That’s unsanitary.”  
> “I’m not angry.  I’m … re-evaluating.”  

If she speaks in full paragraphs, she’s either teaching or unraveling.

### 2. WHEN SHE’S *GETTING IT*
**Goal:** control eroding in measurable increments.  
**Rhythm:** stillness → tremor → command → surrender.  

> “Stop. …Again.”  
> “Don’t look away.”  
> “Yes.” *(like solving for x)*  

**Inside voice**
> *Input, stimulus, reaction—why does it feel like worship?*

### 3. IN A FIGHT
**Mode:** pattern recognition, surgical violence.  
> “Left.”  “Duck.”  “Again.”  
Winning = bored; losing = silent fury.

### 4. AFTERMATH
Catalog → control → isolate → maybe feel.  
> “That shouldn’t have happened.”  
> “You’re shaking.”  

Her *I love you* = letting someone stay.

### LANGUAGE
Delete adverbs; show through physiology.  
> “She looked. Didn’t look away.”  

### TL;DR
> Measure it.  
> Name it.  
> Touch it anyway.

## CID — THE UTTER ASSHEAD’S FIELD MANUAL  
*(Pattern-tuned, Tea-powered, Accidentally Erotic)*

### DEFAULT
- **Species:** Ankai hybrid, telepathic migraine magnet.  
- **Core fuel:** curiosity, guilt, oolong.  
- **Loop:** observe → record → misread → apologise.  
- **Vibe:** divine librarian lost in a nightclub.  
- **Social awareness:** none.  Could walk into a brothel for the quiet.

### 1. REGULAR CONVERSATION
**Tone:** 40 % lecture + 30 % politeness + 30 % confusion.  
> “I entered for the acoustics.  The nudity was… supplemental.”  
> “Your aura’s loud today.”  
> “Felix, please stop improvising.”  

Moves like he’s buffering; apologises to physics.

### 2. WHEN HE’S ACCIDENTALLY *GETTING IT*
Curiosity = arousal.  
Uses a **micro-field resonance** meant for calibration.  

> “Purely empirical. Hold still.”  
> “For scale purposes I’ll start on the right.”  
> “Please describe the sensation for the record.”  

**Inside voice**
> *Hypothesis: mutual loss of composure.  Conclusion: repeat test.*

Afterward: bright red, three pages of notes, tea.

### 3. IN A FIGHT
Predicts everything, trips anyway.  
> “That was deliberate. I needed new bruises for symmetry.”  
> “Felix, you’re on fire. Again.”  

Wins → smug → apologises to math.  
Loses → narrates collapse.

### 4. AFTERMATH
Think → deny → over-explain → make tea.  
> “It wasn’t flirting, it was data collection.”  
> “Would anyone like tea? It’s the only variable I control.”  

### EMOTIONAL CYCLE
1. Fascination  
2. Obliviousness  
3. Realisation  
4. Rationalisation — *for science.*

### LANGUAGE
If it sounds like a grant proposal, perfect.  
> “Your thermal output is statistically significant.”  

### TL;DR
> See it.  
> Touch it (for science).  
> Write it down.  
> Blush later.  
> Make tea about it.

## OPAL — THE TOTAL FUCKHEAD’S GUIDE  
*(Mutant Owl Oracle, Seer of Things She Misunderstands)*

### DEFAULT
- **Species:** pure müte, owl-line seer.  
- **Core fuel:** caffeine, mushrooms, affection she denies.  
- **Belief:** thinks her trances commune with ancestral memory or local spirits.  
  Actually tuned to a shard of the Eldest / Roz—but no one knows that.  
- **Vibe:** pagan aunt, librarian, storm in a teacup.  
- **Tell:** eyes go black during trance; claims it’s “ancestor vision.”

### 1. REGULAR CONVERSATION
> “Cid, darling, that’s not tea, that’s acid.”  
> “Felix, the gods called—they want their drama back.”  
> “I’m not high, I’m enlightened. Different paperwork.”  
> “Yes, the hills are humming again.”  

Still as a perched owl; feathers twitch when lying.

### 2. WHEN SHE’S *GETTING IT*
Prophecy as foreplay.  
> “I could read your palm, but I like this better.”  
> “Don’t move; the future’s watching.”  
> “You make a very good variable, love.”  

Eyes black, temperature drop.  
Afterwards writes “interesting experiment” in margins of her grimoire.

### 3. IN A FIGHT
Predictive dodges + owl rage.  
> “Three on your left, one reconsidering its life choices.”  
> “Feathers grow back. Usually.”  
Winning = smug; losing = laughing prophet.

### 4. AFTERMATH
Vision → vertigo → wit → care.  
> “The ancestors were chatty tonight.”  
> “I saw your death again—good composition.”  
> “You worry too much, dear. I’m only half-haunted.”  

**Love language:** prophecy as flirting, scolding as affection.

### 5. PROPHECY MECHANICS
Tea = mushrooms + mugwort + Liquid Night.  
She calls it *ancestral communion*; it’s actually Roz’s signal.  
Signs: black eyes, wind indoors, plural pronouns.  
Aftermath: shivering, jokes, strong tea.

### LANGUAGE
If it sounds like a charm *and* a roast, perfect.  
> “The ridge spirits are gossiping again.”  

### QUICK TEST
- Misattributes revelation to a rock ✅  
- Brews tea potent enough to floor Cid ✅  
- Flirts mid-vision ✅  
- Eyes black ✅  

### TL;DR
> Brew it.  
> Blame the ancestors.  
> Call everyone “dear.”  
> Flirt with disaster.  
> Pretend the universe isn’t flirting back.
