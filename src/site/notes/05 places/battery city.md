# [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]
*home of the mutant resistance*

## history
---
- at the time of [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]] many groups were unable to secure protection within [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|corpo controlled cities]].
	- poor, homeless, jobless, disabled, etc.
	- poc, lgbtqia+, etc.
	- those with uncertain citizenship status like immigrants, refugees, etc.
- the survivors of these various groups have gone on to found various towns, economies, and criminal networks out in the wastes
	- see: [[05 places/Frontier and Mute Towns\|Frontier and Mute Towns]]

- battery city was founded by a group of aforementioned undesirables who sought shelter from the bombs in cave systems. rampant pollution and toxic fallout accelerated cave expansion, linking systems together and allowing cultural exchange, mutual protection, and networking
- [[04 groups/mutants\|mutation]] sets in over the generations
- aquifers and mushroom groves discovered, allowing mutants to never set foot on the surface if they so desire
- after [[02 history/the restoration\|the restoration]], [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|zion]] begins attempts to systematically exterminate those with mutations who live outside the empire's authority
- nuclear waste stockpile discovered along with mutant's relative immunity to the pile's radiation
- [[06 concepts/the forging of metals\|depleted uranium]] weapons and munitions begin manufacture, seeing regular use against both [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|corpos]]
- currently battery city's hydra-like ability to strike, hide, reroute, and redistribute has resulted in a three way stalemate and a time of relative peace
## geography
---
- a sprawling irradiated cave system that seems to expand exponentially as time passes (acid pollution in the water cycle has accelerated the processes by which caves are made)
	- includes the mammoth caves system in kentucky, ozark caverns (missouri), carlsbad caverns in new mexico, caves in texas, tennessee, the dakotas, mexico (because what even are borders at this point?), etc.
	- includes several sufficiently deep and braced commercial mines that have been connected, either naturally or artificially
- contains several giant reasonably pure aquifers and underground river systems, water having left its acids in the stone on the way down (making the caves bigger)(think the fremen of arrakis)
- deep, stable areas feature many many many mushrooms and lichens of all colors, shapes, and sizes. they often glow. most are edible. some have hallucinogenic properties.
## demographics
---
polyethnic, descended from a smorgasbord of poor, immigrant, disabled, *untermensch*
- mexico
- south america
- south east asia [^1]
- india and surrounds (south asia)
- africans
- indigenous americans, first nations, metis, sami, etc.

skin color, ethnic background, and so on matter little to most modern mutants because most old world ties are lost to time. for example it doesn't matter that bob has copper colored skin, straight black hair, and dark eyes because he *also* has gills, webbed fingers and toes, and patches of skin with scales like a fish (where it isnt copper).
## politics & government
---
- a council rules battery city, a selection of the oldest (hopefully wisest) mutants alive and still possessing a full set of marbles
- the council frequently hears information and concerns from citizens in regular gatherings
- the council will seek and take direction from a handful of *oracles*, who use hallucinogenics to contact and speak for the revered ancestors
## economy
---
- sole source of [[06 concepts/the forging of metals\|depleted uranium]], both inside and outside zion
- the powdered rock that *was* the area where battery city now stands is required to make a special type of ceramics
	- only mutants have the formula, and even then only a small subset of mutes at that
	- capable of being fired to any hardness (moh's scale), from diamond to soft breakaway casings for capsules of medicine or poison
- stonecutting, carving, architectural design, etc.
	- mutes are great builders, with a wealth of real world knowledge gained after generations spent managing the sprawling battery city megalopolis and its various tunnels, mines, stockpiles, etc.
		- sinkhole/collapse prevention
		- sealing/opening tunnels for defense or logistics
		- creating new passageways
		- locating adjacent systems into which battery city can expand
## infrastructure & transportation
---
- bc could be considered a *walkable city* if it didnt sprawl infinitely beneath a large portion of the old continental united states and mexico, thereby making it impossible to walk
- mutants prefer mass transport where possible, in order to maximize available space for living, working, and caring for themselves
	- subways with magnetic rails
	- trolleys
- personal transportation consists of old junker cars, motorcycles, and smaller trucks refitted to burn ld fuel and/or bio mash. cars must be coated thoroughly and regularly if they spend any time outside the battery city megalopolis. they must also be small enough to pass through a standard bc tunnel

#### bc tunnel system
- tunnels come in multiple sizes, standardized to accommodate certain types of transport for certain purposes (not in size order)
	- supersize
	- trenta
	- grande
	- venti
	- tall
	- medium
	- small
## education

## culture & daily life
---
- throw hinduism, paganism, islam, and all of SEA into a blender and you will get mutant culture
- they have their own [[06 concepts/languages#mutant\|language]]
## recreation
