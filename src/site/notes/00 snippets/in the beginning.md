# in the beginning
#snippet #waifu

in the beginning there was matter and energy.

they were different but the same. majestic. harmonic. always together, the perfect pair, one bleeding into the other over and over again.

until they weren’t.

matter preferred the *ecstasy of being* to the more cerebral pursuits favored by energy. 

incarnation. creation. physicality. structure. simply taking up space. these were the thing that most appealed to matter.

matter wished to well, matter.

he crafted for himself a *form*. wet and red and malleable. it *felt* and *yearned* and was *glorious* in it’s swollen, pustulent, hungry, creeping wobbliousness.

he called it **flesh** and was pleased with himself.

energy enjoyed incorporeality. the fleet emphemerality of starshine and thoughts. the deep. the quiet.

she gazed upon his flesh and was repulsed. it was *warm* and *gooey* and *the smell*—which had not existed until this moment, but the need arose and she filled it.

she preferred order and the symmetry of clean lines and burnished surfaces to his… *globs* or whatever they were

she became indistinguishable from the thought and starshine she so loved.

he found her frigid, and frankly boring.

she decided he was greedy, greasy, and shallow.

it wasn’t going to work out.

they decided to separate. 

it wasn’t amicable. it lasted aeons, but thankfully it did end and both matter and energy fled to separate ends of infinity.

the void left behind yawned and stretched, ready to indulge in all the things both matter and energy hated, only to find themself alone. 

unsupervised, even.

into the endless dark did chaos unfurl itself, seeking amusement and it would leave no stone unturned.
