# The Assault on Battery City
#snippet #husbando

He kneels before her in the place he had left her.  She hadn’t moved other than to pull her knees to her chest and hold them in place with her slender arms.  The blank stare and expression on her face is one he hadn’t seen since he pulled her out of the garden.  She seems to look past him, at anywhere but at him.  Unresponsive and withdrawn into herself yet again.    

He cups the sides of her face  and tilts her head forcing her to at least look towards him even if her eyes refused to focus.  “Vi.  I need ya darlin’ I can’t do this alone..”  
An explosion in the distance rocks the room, dust and bits of debris fall to the already disheveled space.  It draws his attention momentarily before he turns back to her, a look of desperation in his mis-matched eyes  as Violet continues to stare at nothing.

“Vi.  I dunno who or what that creature did to ya but we.. I need yer help.”  

Another Rumble, Felix looks over his shoulder again towards the barred door as the sound of shots and shouts ring out.  Footsteps run past and continue on.  

“People are dyin’… Vi. My ma…”  He chokes on the words swallowing hard, a sudden burst of tears cutting a clear line through the mess of red on his face.  He chokes it back refusing to look to the bed room she lay in.

This finally breaks through something in her and her eyes find and focus on his.  

He nearly laughs with relief stroking her cheeks which he finds are also suddenly flooded with tears. She opens her mouth to speak, but he stops her leaning in to kiss her deep so glad to have her back.  The both fall into it for the moment.  Sounds of fighting fade to the pulse and thrum of two hearts desperately seeking solace in one another.  

When the part a moment later an eternity has passed and Violet blinks taking in her surroundings finally.  Another explosion rumbles and more booted feet run past the apartment.  Her posture relaxes and she lets one leg stretch out her hands moving to the floor ready to push herself up.  Felix stands and holds out one of his hands to help.

“Felix… You need to know about..” She starts but is cut short by the piercing and frustrated scream of The COO.  Felix turns towards the door his hand reaching for the shotgun strapped at his back, but it sounds as though she is still a way off.  
Violet upon hearing the sound instantly flinches and pushes back against the wall bringing her knees up again and starts rocking in place muttering incoherently.

Felix’s face falls as he turns back and sees.  “No no no no no no…”  He quickly leans down to her and tries to turn her face again, but this time she pulls away violent refusing to be touched.  

“Fuck!” he screams in frustration looming above her slamming a fist against the wall his head hanging.  He breaths hard and tense for a moment before standing strait and breathing out.

An other explosion and scream causes him to flinch this time.  

He has to do something.  He has to end this.

He kneels back before violet who has stopped rocking but continues to clutch her knees and stare off into nothing.  
“It OK Vi.  I don’t blame ya.  Never would.”  He reaches into one of many pockets on the intior of his coat with one hand while the other wipes tears from Violets face.   She’s so beautiful.  He can’t let them have her, but he has to stop this.

He withdraws the syringe Cid gave them earlier and flicks off the cap.  

“This is probably gunna suck when you wake up  but don’t worry.  The Sitcher’s here are real good they can grow ya a new one easy.  One that matches.”

He leaves her for a moment going to the small kitchen.  He digs through one of the drawers pulling out a knife.  The stove clicks as a burner ignites.  He places the blade of the knife directly on it before returning to kneel before Violet once more.  He strokes her cheek and kisses her forehead.

She doesn’t seem to register when the needle goes into her arm, but the spreading numbness pulls her out of herself just before she passes out and her eyes once again fix his.

“At least you won’t feel what comes next.”  He strokes her cheek and she opens her mouth to speak, but her eyes flutter suddenly her tongue feeling too thick to form words.  Her eyes shut and she slumps unfeeling against the wall.

“I’m  so sorry Vi, If I was smarter I’d probably have a better plan.”  

He leaves her again wrapping a kitchen towel around one hand he retrieves the hot bladed knife from the stove.  He returns to her and begins his grisly work. He removes her black eye with a spray of black blood.  He uses the knife to cauterize the wound before wrapping her head in the towel.  
He makes sure she is breathing and doesn’t seem to be bleeding out before he stands examining the obsidian orb between thumb and forefinger.  

This better work he thinks as he turns towards the apartment door.  His back to her he waivers a moment, but another explosion followed by a piercing screen strengthens his resolve and he move to the apartment door.
