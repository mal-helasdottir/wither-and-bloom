# acolytes of the infinite pattern
slang: "[[04 groups/lanky boys\|lanky boys]]" though not all members of this faction are [[04 groups/anunnaki\|anunnaki]] nor their descendants

## 🧬 Acolyte Lineage & Social Hierarchy

The Acolytes of the Pattern (often referred to as “lanky boys”) trace their origins to the **Annunaki**, an extraterrestrial species who arrived on Earth millennia ago. Over time, the Annunaki interbred with humans, creating several generations of hybrids known as **Ankai**.

### 📊 Generational Breakdown

- **Annunaki (Gen 0)**  
  - Tall, long-limbed, six-digited, alien physiology  
  - Rare, venerated, near-immortal  
  - Considered godlike in Acolyte society

- **Gen 1 (Annunaki + Human)**  
  - Earliest hybrids — highly valued but rare  
  - May be unstable or sterile depending on method of union

- **Gen 2 (Ankai + Ankai)**  
  - Considered **true Ankai**  
  - Most respected among Acolytes  
  - Eligible for high-ranking roles within Pattern-aligned hierarchies

- **Gen 3 (Ankai + Human)**  
  - Often indistinguishable from humans  
  - Still retain minor alien features (e.g. vibrant eyes, pale hair)  
  - Socially inferior to Gen 2; sometimes tolerated, often marginalized

- **Gen 4+ (Human + trace Ankai ancestry)**  
  - Considered **“basically human”** by Annunaki and high Ankai  
  - Denied access to sacred knowledge or upper caste privileges  
  - May still serve as Acolytes, but with minimal clout

> “In terms of the actual Annunaki and the Gen 2 Ankai, anything past Gen 3 isn't even worth notice to them and they just consider them human.”

### 🧠 Cultural Notes

- **Mating with humans below Gen 2** is taboo for many high-ranking Ankai.  
- Acolyte society is **deeply stratified** by genetic proximity to the Annunaki.  
- Power, access, and authority within Pattern factions flow from **blood purity**.

> “Obviously Annunaki and Ankai crosses would be ‘better’ genetically than Annunaki x Human… Gen 4 would be a great-great grandparent, but at that point you’re basically human.”
