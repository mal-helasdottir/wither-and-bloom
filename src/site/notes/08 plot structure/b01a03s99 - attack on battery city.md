# Arc: Attack on Battery City  
## Placement: End of Book One  
## Status: Canon (Scene Scaffold)  
## Format: Detailed Beat Sheet

---

## ⛰️ SETTING

- **Location:** Battery City, an underground müte stronghold.
- **Proximity:** Felix and Violet are in Winne — Felix’s mobile base, part Winnebago, part 18-wheeler, parked near or just outside the city itself.
- **Tone:** Post-coital stillness following the “Firsts” scene — intimate, quiet, peaceful. The last moment of safety before total collapse.
- **Narrative Purpose:** To shatter the illusion of sanctuary, reintroduce Rose as antagonist, sever the emotional tether between Violet and her past, and remove Felix from the board via capture.

## 🧨 BEAT 1: The Idyll is Broken

- A massive corpo strike hits Battery City without warning.  
- It is not precise. It is not subtle. Think: End of Evangelion — catastrophic, apocalyptic force.  
- Possibly dropped from orbit, possibly boring down from above.  
- Explosives breach the earth, rupturing the upper levels of the underground stronghold.  
- There may be a glimpse of open sky or surface light — something unnatural and terrifying for those who’ve only known life underground.  
- Winne is not in the blast radius, but the shockwave is devastating.  
- Violet’s spine activates; her biosuit reacts to the threat.  
- Felix is thrown into motion — the peace is shattered.

---

## 📡 BEAT 2: The Broadcast

- A corpo communication override takes over every active channel.  
- Rose speaks.  
- She is addressing all of Battery City — not just Felix and Violet.  
- She demands her sister be returned to her. If not, she will continue the destruction.  
- Her voice is not right. It is Violet’s voice but wrong — dry, stitched together, like it's reanimated vocal cords speaking through a dead throat.  
- Violet hears it. She freezes. Then collapses.  
- This is her Shinji breakdown. She enters a state of complete catatonia, same as the moment in Eden.  
- She remembers the truth:  
  - Rose is dead.  
  - Violet killed her.  
  - She has been running from this for a long time.  
- Now there is no escape. Denial collapses in an instant.

---

## 👁️ BEAT 3: The Eye Removal

- Violet remains catatonic — unable to move or respond.  
- Felix recognizes the signs.  
- He’s seen her like this before — back in Eden, when he found her cradling a severed white-haired head in the dark.  
- That head had red eyes, slightly open but utterly vacant.  
- Felix strongly suspected at the time that it was Rose — but chose not to say anything. He never had proof.  
- Now, with the broadcast, everything clicks into place.  
- Violet is lost. He cannot bring her with him. She’ll die if he does.  
- He decides to fake her death.  
- He removes her black, witch-marked eye — the one Eden scientists saw as a blemish, but which is in truth her witch mark, bestowed by Roz as part of her ability to wither and bloom.  
- It is surgical. Not violent. Not rushed.  
- He leaves her behind, in Winne, safe.

## 🍽️ BEAT 4: The Eye Monch

- Felix goes to confront Rose — possibly walking into the city, possibly surrendering himself to a patrol or skirmish force.  
- He has the eye with him.  
- When asked for proof, or when facing Rose directly, he says:  
  - “She’s dead. I killed her. I ate her.”  
- Then — in front of Rose — he eats Violet’s eye.  
- This is not magical. It is psychological warfare.  
- He knows what this means to Rose. He weaponizes it.  
- She loses her composure — outraged, shocked, furious.  
- And she attacks.

---

## 🩸 BEAT 5: The Fight

- Rose demolishes Felix. There is no contest.  
- He gets wrecked — possibly crushed, flung, torn.  
- But then... he gets back up.  
- She hits him again — he gets up again.  
- He’s grinning. Bleeding. Laughing, maybe. Or just refusing to die.  
- She realizes something is very wrong.  
- Felix’s healing factor — subtle until now — is doing overtime.  
- He is healing too quickly. Too cleanly.  
- She has no explanation for it — except this:  
  - He traveled with Violet.  
  - He ate her eye.  
  - And now... he doesn’t stay down.

---

## 🧬 BEAT 6: The Capture

- At some point in the fight, Rose takes Felix’s arm — maybe accidentally, maybe as an experiment.  
- She consumes it.  
- That’s when she knows — the healing ability transfers.  
- She now has a version of Felix’s healing factor. Possibly permanent.  
- It’s enough to change the game.  
- Felix is captured.  
  - Likely restrained.  
  - Possibly unconscious.  
  - Probably still smirking.  
- Rose sees him as a valuable biological asset:  
  - A way to replicate Violet’s mutation.  
  - A walking regeneration template.  
  - A data trove of genetic information — especially now that he’s consumed Violet’s witch-mark.

---

## 🔚 OUTCOME / TRANSITION

- Violet is missing, presumed dead by the corpos. Winne remains hidden or is moved.  
- Felix is gone — a captive of Rose and corpo command.  
- Battery City is in ruins.  
- The prodigy project has just acquired two things:  
  - A partial witch-marked sample (inside Felix).  
  - A viable healing template (Felix himself).

---

## 💡 THEME NOTES

- Loss of sanctuary: Winne was a temporary home. That home is gone.  
- Loss of control: Violet is rendered inert by trauma. Felix is taken.  
- Mutation as inheritance: By eating each other, enemies become each other.  
- Identity shattering: Violet and Rose’s twinship is severed here. Violet becomes something else.

## 🪞 MIRRORS

- Violet’s catatonia mirrors her first state in Eden.  
- Felix’s sacrifice mirrors her own — he risks everything to give her a chance to survive.  
- Rose’s consumption of Felix’s arm mirrors the apotheosis structure — taking divine traits through flesh.
