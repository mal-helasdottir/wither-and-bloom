# languages

## corporate
*the official tongue of the holy empire of zion*
- meant to be used in all official communications: marriage contracts, imperial notices, writs of bondage, etc.
- any and all documents *not* written in corporate with at least 2 witnesses and accompanying seals affixed is considered void of any legal standing

> [!FAQ]- suggested other names
> legalese, mercantile, commerce
## mutant
*a patois of many uncouth languages used only by rampant mutants*
- constantly shifting tongue and flexible cant style[^1] writing system used only by mutants
	- not because of any greater conspiracy to keep it away from reggies (regular corpos), but because outside groups refuse to show any interest in it whatsoever--that would give it credence and therefore power
- even if a reggie decided to learn it would be difficult
	- limited sounds and cyphers create a language of subtleties that relies heavily on body language, tone, and implication (like mandarin)
	- no one would teach them

## enochian
*the sacred language of the elder ones*
- totally alien method of communication consisting of unpronounceable syllables and mental imaging
- the pool of speakers is limited to the eldest three and the ceo

## screwtape
[^2]*demonic communication*
- spoken by demons and devils amongst themselves
- there is no accompanying written language, which makes sense considering the short gnat-like lives of most lesser demons
	- if writing is required it in done in corporate, but few of the species have enough mental wherewithal or patience for the process of writing or even recalling letters

## english
*lost after the revelation*
- normally found on ancient signage and other remnants of pre-[[02 history/the revelation\|revelation]] infrastructure
- only high ranking members of the inner circle can communicate in english, along with [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]
	- used in their secret rituals and services
