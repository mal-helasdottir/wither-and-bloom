## THE HOUSES (SEPHIROT)

The corporate empire is organized into Houses named after the Sephirot of Kabbalah. Each House is also a seat on the Board. "The board is the houses is the board is the houses is the board." (vamp, 4/29/2025)

### OPEN QUESTIONS

**CEO and Keter:**

- Doggo said "leave Keter for the CEO" (4/29/2025)
- vamp pushed back: "im wondering if he shouldnt have a house tho? the entire exercise is about becoming god. he should be beyond kether" (4/29/2025)
- **User position (12/3/2025):** CEO is beyond Keter. "he just thinks his shits are that hot."

**Da'at vs Netzach confusion:**

- Doggo said "Da'at is the brain while Nez is the mouth" (4/29/2025) — implying Netzach does propaganda
- But also said "Hod is Hollywood" and Hod works with Da'at (4/29/2025)
- Netzach was also assigned as internal security/gestapo
- **Needs resolution:** Is Netzach propaganda or internal security? Probably internal security, with Hod as the public face.

**House dynamics:**

- Geburah and Chesed are close in power — "i do like how close in power geburah and chesed are / feels correct" (vamp 4/29/2025)
- Hod and Da'at work closely — "they are the clandestine side that write the scripts while hod puts on the play" (Doggo 4/29/2025)

## THE FRANCHISES

Franchise cities of the Corporate Empire of Zion. Each franchise has an associated Garden and Demonfield (the triad structure).

### CONFIRMED FRANCHISES

|Franchise|Location|Industry|Citation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Zion**|Austin or Houston, TX|Energy/Power, CEO's seat, capital|Doggo 7/18/2024: "The CEO was head of an Oil and Gas/Energy Solutions company, and many of those are based in Texas"|
|**Jericho**|Roswell, NM area (possibly built from Area 51)|Military/Defense|Doggo 7/18/2024; vamp 7/18/2024 — "military industry, popular hub for smuggling"|
|**Cana**|Somewhere on the coast (see conflicts)|Resort/Leisure, Pacific port|Doggo 7/18/2024 — detailed description|
|**Bethlehem**|Near El Paso|Propaganda birthplace, paired with Gluttony field|Multiple references|
|**Nazareth**|TBD|Propaganda/Communications|Listed in franchise locations|
|**Magdala**|TBD|Education/Science — "synthetic flesh operations and new ways to use it"|Doggo 8/15/2024|

### FLOATED FRANCHISES

|Franchise|Industry|Citation|
|---|---|---|
|**Bethsaida**|Religion — "worship of the CEO and the sacred nature of the Flesh"|Doggo 8/15/2024: "Maybe like Magdala is Education and Bethsaida is religion since Education and Religion can often be at odds"|

### FRANCHISE DETAILS

**Zion (Austin/Houston):**

> "Zion is home to most of the empire's 'natural' humans. Gene surgery and flesh warping is often used to remove any minor abnormalities and perfect their form meaning various looks/skintones/faces and body shapes go in and out of vogue in Zion like a style of dress or suit might have in the past. High Fashion is more about the set of your cheek bones and your style of nose than the color and cut of your dress is. (this has the effect of many of the most wealthy often looking very similar to one another). The Mutant ghetto in Zion is smaller than most other cities as most of the Mutants in town live in servants quarters or board houses of the families they are indentured to, which makes sneaking into the Zion harder for non-corpo mutes." — Doggo 7/18/2024

**Jericho (Roswell):**

> "The Military capital of the empire. Built up from what was once Roswell New Mexico it spans across a large section of the waste for troop trainings and bases, etc. less a tall city more a spread out one though it does have some skyscrapers and its walls are nearly as strong as Zions. Features a very large Mutant population as many are drafted into military service to serve as canon fodder for the Imperial army. As such the mutant ghetto in Jericho is the largest of the corpo cities and has become a smuggling hub. The town on the whole is rampant with corruption and several military officers are little better than crime lords/mobsters within their various districts they oversee. This is where Felix was born." — Doggo 7/18/2024

**Cana (Coastal — location disputed):**

> "A resort Destination for corporate getaways. Located somewhere in what was either San Diego or Orange CA. This is also the closest functioning port of call into the pacific ocean which could give access to the remains of the Fallen Flesh and the base there (perhaps an underwater demon field?) The vibe is very resort town, but like everywhere there is a strong military presence. Only Humans are able to enjoy the touristy areas filled with boutique surgeons and fleshwarpers as well as all the best shopping and the only Beach with tolerable nuclear levels! (no rad suits required, just a quick gene bath after!) Because of the large need for laborers and servants to cater to normie tourists, there is a large mutant population, the ghetto in Cana, while not quite as large as the one in Jericho, is almost as if not more densely populated. Smuggling is prime here as well." — Doggo 7/18/2024

**Magdala — Necropolis flavor (floated):**

> "No I mean it's a town of mausoleums / A city of the dead and an ostentatious display of wealth / The way John Gaius has that special place of his that's an ossuary he lives in" — vamp 8/15/2024

> "So a secret group of brothers could live in the city of the dead because other than dead people it's just caretakers and mourners... And they occasionally sneak out and fucking..... Steal some shit. Artifacts and knowledge for their hoard they never use for anything helpful / Necropolis I believe is the word" — vamp 8/15/2024

### LOCATION CONFLICTS

**⚠️ Cana location:**

- Doggo 7/18/2024 (early): "San Diego or Orange CA"
- Doggo 7/18/2024 (later same day): "Cana is New Orleans or someplace in Florida"
- vamp 7/18/2024: "Cana could have also been Vegas previously"
- **User position (12/3/2025):** "definitely somewhere on the coast is cana--course with sea levels and such the coastline could be in fucking nebraska now"

**Vegas:**

- Doggo 7/18/2024: "Vegas could also make a field"
- vamp 12/30/2024: "you mean mutant vegas? i thought we'd planned for a settlement like that?"
- **User position (12/3/2025):** "vegas probably works better as a demonfield"

## THE DEMONFIELDS

Nine concentrated Flesh zones, each ruled by a Devil Prince (failed Prodigy Project child).

### CONFIRMED FIELDS

|Field|Circle|Location|Prince|Citation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Gluttony**|3rd|Outside Bethlehem (El Paso), near Eden|Cerberus (possibly formed from twins/triplets)|Doggo 7/23/2024|
|**Treachery**|9th|Inside CEO's residence/office in Zion|The CEO himself?|demonfields.md|

### FLOATED FIELDS

|Field|Circle|Location|Prince|Citation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Limbo**|Vestibule|Between Battery City and nearest corpo town|Baba Yaga|Doggo 7/23/2024 — BUT SEE CONFLICT|
|**Lust**|2nd|TBD|"Beast with two backs" — two candidates who fused|Doggo 12/20/2024|
|**Violence**|7th|Civil War battlefield (Gettysburg? Shiloh?)|TBD|demonfields.md|
|**Vegas field**|TBD|Las Vegas|TBD|User 12/3/2025: "vegas probably works better as a demonfield"|
|**Houston field**|TBD|Houston (flooded/swampy)|TBD|Doggo 7/18/2024: "I think Houston might be one of the Demonfields"|

### FIELD DETAILS

**Gluttony:**

> "I Just think Gluttony is a good intro to demonfields because the demons there would be more bestial and well hungry. And it could be a wild contrast to one they go in later in the story. I think the Devil in charge of the field really dictates what the rest of the field is like. So maybe this one is all beasties because the strongest creature there is a beastie and eats anything that doesn't follow suit so all the lessers are constantly hunting, each other or anything that wanders in. a very dangerous one but like simple to understand. This is what most people who have never been in a field think they are all like, and while there might be a degree of it in all fields others may have more subtle masters and rules." — Doggo 7/23/2024

**Limbo (Battery City deal):**

> "Like I think Limbo might be a smaller field that is between Battery City and its closest corpo town and they use it 1 as a buffer and two as a place to quietly dump mutants who have used too much Liquid Night in service of the rebellion. And as a result some of the demons and the devil there can be reasoned with." — Doggo 7/23/2024

### ⚠️ LIMBO CONFLICT

- Doggo 7/23/2024: Limbo is a full field with Baba Yaga, Battery City dumps burned-out mutants there
- vamp 12/20/2024: "i dont think limbo is a field tho tbh. i feel like limbo should maybe just be used to designate the no mans land between the regular wastes and a demonfield"
- **Needs resolution:** Is Limbo a true field or a geographic term for border zones?

### FIELD STRUCTURE

**Origin:**

> "What if the devils that lead the various demon fields are all failed attempts at creating a prodigy like maybe that's how they formed right. Kids are grown. A fraction of the fallen flesh's power is given to them. Same test that made rose go mad. They weren't stopped and killed though so they became devils. And the fields grew from them basically. So at the center of each field is a garden/nursery." — Doggo 7/26/2024

**Field borders — 9 separate, not concentric:**

> vamp 7/18/2024: "I was thinking they were concentric / Around the most terrible horrible disgusting fear inducing whatever in the very center / Like the original" Doggo 7/18/2024: "I like the idea that there are multiple and each one has a Devil Lord in its center. Also it means like you can have different environments. one could be in the ruins of a city (dis) one can be in a forest (suicide woods) one is in the desert. etc etc." vamp 7/18/2024: "There can still be commanders... Have to think about it" Doggo 7/18/2024: "I don't think it has to be exactly like Inferno to still ref it."

**Settled:** 9 separate scattered fields, not one concentric structure.

## NAMING CONVENTIONS

### Biblical (New Testament) — for Franchises

> "Well biblically Judah is the kingdom of israel. Also called 'Canaan' or 'Judea'. Some cities of note include: Nazareth, Bethlehem, Cana, Jerusalem, Jericho, Jaffa, Ascalon, Samaria" — vamp 7/17/2024

### Canaanite Gods — for Houses/Ruling Families (floated)

> "im talking simply about naming the ruling families of zion's franchises after these gods / so the city where they entomb the dead and care for their graves would be ruled by house mot / because mot was the original canaanite god of death" — vamp 11/21/2024

**Not confirmed by Doggo** — he asked "did they have religious houses?" suggesting unfamiliarity

## NAMING CONVENTIONS — DEMONFIELDS & FAUNA

### Two-Layer System

**OUR framework (design doc):**

- Sephirot = Houses (public institutions)
- Qliphoth = Demonfields (shadow of each House)
- Hell Circles = thematic sin category
- Symmetrical, allegorical, satisfying

**IN-UNIVERSE:**

- Characters don't see the meta-pattern
- Names come from whoever found/named things first
- Different factions use different terminology

### Corpo Naming

Clinical. Alphanumeric. Dehumanizing.

- BETHLEHEM EXCLUSION ZONE VII
- GETHSEMANE ANOMALY FIELD ALPHA
- FLESH MANIFESTATION TYPE 7-B
- HOSTILE FAUNA CATEGORY: APEX

These aren't PLACES with RULERS. They're containment problems. Insurance liabilities. Zoning issues.

### Brotherhood/Mutant Naming — Three Schools

**The Inferno School (DOMINANT):**

- Dante's circles: Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Wrath, etc.
- Dante wrote the Comedy in vernacular Italian so common people could understand
- Brotherhood teaches it the same way — accessible, poetic, spreads easily
- This is what Felix learned. What he teaches Violet. What spreads through ghettos.
- **THIS IS CANON FOR POV CHARACTERS.**

**The Qliphoth School:**

- Thaumiel, Gamchicoth, Golachab, Choronzon...
- Deliberate inversion of corpo's precious Sephirot
- "You named your holy Houses after the Tree of Life? We name your HELLS after its shadow. Fuck you."
- Esoteric, stays mostly within Brotherhood academic circles

**The Fallen Angel School:**

- Lucifer, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Mammon, Leviathan...
- Names the RULERS, not the places
- May overlap with what Devil Princes call themselves
- Debate: Did Princes choose these names, or did the names summon them?

### Bestiary Naming

Brotherhood as accidental taxonomists. They hoard books, find shit in rubble, name horrors after what they've read.

- **Jabberwock** — big teeth (Through the Looking-Glass)
- **Bandersnatch** — fast and frumious (same)
- **Manticore** — mythology book
- **Seraphim** — too many wings and eyes (ironic or sincere, depends on the Brother)

Same creature, two languages:

- Mutant: "Jabberwock"
- Corpo: "HOSTILE FAUNA CATEGORY: APEX-7"

### Literacy & Language

**CEO & Board:**

- Alive pre-Revelation, speak Old English natively
- Full context. They REMEMBER. Signs aren't archaeology — they're nostalgia.

**Corpo elite:**

- Taught pre-Rev English as prestige education (like Latin in medieval Europe)
- Proof of civilization, education, HUMANITY
- Gaps exist — second language, not living memory

**Brotherhood:**

- Self-taught from salvage. Functional literacy.
- Reconstructed meaning through cross-reference and guesswork
- Their "translations" are scholarship, not memory

**Common mutants:**

- Oral tradition only
- "Jabberwock" and "Gluttony" just ARE. No source text needed.
- Felix sees "EL PASO 250" — gibberish. Cid can read it but still guesses what it means.

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR RESOLUTION

1. **Limbo:** Field or geographic term?
2. **Cana location:** Coastal California vs Gulf Coast vs Vegas?
3. **Vegas:** Demonfield (user preference 12/3/2025) or waster settlement?
4. **CEO and Keter:** Does he have a house or is he beyond them?
5. **Netzach function:** Internal security or propaganda mouth?
6. **Industry ↔ Hell circle pairings:** Not yet mapped
7. **Remaining field locations:** Lust, Greed, Wrath/Sloth, Heresy, Fraud
8. **Remaining franchise industries:** Bethlehem, Nazareth specifics
9. **Tiferet, Yesod, Malkuth:** Unassigned houses
