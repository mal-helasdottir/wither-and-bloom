## vibe check
### tunes to drive over the wastes to
- *knights of cydonia*, muse
- *s/c/a/r/e/c/r/o/w*, my chemical romance
- *na na na (na na na na na na na na na)*, my chemical romance
- *shoulder to the wheel*, saves the day
- *far from any road*, the handsome family
	- *from the dusty mesa her looming shadow grows, hidden in the branches of the poison creosote. she twines her spines up slowly towards the boiling sun and when i touched her skin my fingers ran with blood.* the wastes really do be like that bro. t
### tunes to make out with your mutant boyfriend to
- *the light behind your eyes*, my chemical romance
	- *we'll say goodbye today and i'm sorry how it ends this way. if you promise not to cry then i'll tell just what i would say if i could be with you tonight. i would sing you to sleep. never let them take the light behind your eyes. i failed and lost this fight; never fade in the dark. just remember you will always burn as bright.* felix thinks he'll let her down one day and he will be taken from her. but she's strong and she'll grow stronger, because the light inside her will never die. he's going to make sure of it before that day comes. t
- *rain*, sleep token
	- each feels as if the only redeeming thing about themselves is they love the other fiercely, to the death. that the other person is their reason to breathe and keeping them safe is a path to redemption and salvation. *just like the rain you cast the dust into nothing and wash out the salt from my hands. so touch me again i feel my shadow dissolving. will you cleanse me with pleasure?* there's shades of being undeserving of this grace too, perhaps being a bad person becase of doing bad things, but somehow this lover stays and makes them happy. *im coiled up like the venomous serpent, tandgled in your trance and i'm certain you have got your hooks in me. i know, i know the way that it goes. you get what you get, you reap what you sow, and i can see you in my fate. i know, i know i am what i am, the mouth of the wolf, the eyes of the lamb. so darling, will you saturate? when i open my eyes to the future i can hear you say my name.* t

## the gods 
### [[03 people/The Fallen Flesh\|the flesh]]
- *body*, mother mother
	- the way the flesh is offered up and consumed by lesser beings after his power, [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s mirroring of these actions as he creates minions, the cannibalistic nature of [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and devils and a little tongue and cheek reference to catholic eucharist. t
- *vore*, sleep token
	- this entire song is fucking peak flesh and its very hard to choose a bit to focus on but i think it's worth mentioning there's just as much material here for the [[02 history/the playlist#the ceo\|ceo]] as there is for the flesh. i think the ceo has always felt lonely and misunderstood. power as a way to get attention and validation and in a way the flesh is the same? *your viscera welcome me in, welcome me in. my life is torn, my bones, they bleed. my metaphors fall short in the end. your flesh and bone welcome me in, welcome me in. are you in pain like I am?* perhaps becoming a horrible tetsuo-like fleshgamation is a comfort to both of them--pity they chose violence after that tho. t
### [[03 people/The Infinite Pattern\|the pattern]]
- *starman*, david bowie
	- extremely innocent take on the infinite pattern, making her seem gentle, interested, positive, etc. she's not any of those things but *let the children boogie*, as they say. t
- *hypnosis*, sleep token
	- *you know you hypnotize me, always*. the pattern hypnotizes. the pattern remakes. the pattern evolves. the pattern is everywhere. *take, take from me. leave nothing left. take everything and give, give me all. all that i want. just give me all.*
- *algorithm*, muse
### [[03 people/The Diminished One\|the diminished]]
- *aspiring fires*, mother mother
	- fire - chaotic, ravenous, uncontrollable, viral, nonsensical. *you wanna see me crazy? well i'll show you it's like and then i'll wave goodbye as you run for your life*. *a little advice for aspiring fires: you get put out if you don't get a little wild*. *because crazy in the box is everything that crazy's not*. t
- *string break song*, charming disaster
	- there is no living without destruction. nothing lasts forever. every day takes you one more closer to the last. *chaos is gonna win in the end, the universe is flying apart, there ain't nothing much you can do about it. burn up the candle or live in the dark*? t
- *alkaline*, sleep token
	- *not acid nor alkaline, caught between black and white, not quite either day or night, {they're} perfectly misaligned*. chaos is all those things and none of those things. *i'm caught up in {their} design and how it connects to mine*. the ultimate plan (that's not a plan, really) to save the universe by introducing a little nonsense and cutting the knees out from under power. *every once in a while something changes and {they're} changing me. it's too late for me now, i am altered--there is something beneath*. the something being secrets implanted beneath skin and bone, the mutations that allow beloveds to shirk the control of **their** more powerful siblings and change the fate of the world. t
- *black sheep* metric
	- our common goal was waiting for the world to end, now the truth is just a rule that you can bend, you crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again.  *changing the rules and changing their shape helps everyone and no one, chaos is also very much THE black sheep of the gods, the diminished half doubly so*

## [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]
- *young god*, halsey
	- *if you wanna go to heaven you should fuck me tonight*
- *everybody wants to rule the world*, lorde
- *we had it all*, pim stones
- *necromancin dancin*, bear ghost
- *mx sinister*, i don't know how but they found me
- *you'd be paranoid too*, water parks
- *enemy*, imagine dragons
- *modern day cain*, i don't know how but they found me
- *pet*, a perfect circle
	- *put your head down go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drum*. if daddy warbucks was both an actual war criminal and a daddy. which is pretty much what the ceo is. t
## [[01 inbox/violet\|01 inbox/violet]]
- *anything like me*, poppy
	- [[09 dynamics/rose x violet\|rose x violet]]
	- *i feel her heart beating in me. get her out of me.* the experience of having [[03 people/rose\|rose]] for a sister and then absorbing part of her, who isn't impressed with violet trying to take her place or abandoning the whole thing. *i'm everything she never was now everyone's out for my blood. stop you're making a scene. you're coming at me with blood in your teeth*. t
- *bleed magic*, i don't know how but they found me
- *build god, then we'll talk*, panic! at the disco
- *delicate weapon*, grimes
- *magdalena*, a perfect circle
	- yes it's a song about a stripper or prostitute and that usually what violet/stel is but hear me out. it's also an explicit reference to mary of [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#magdala\|magdala]] (was she a prostitute or the favorite disciple? to the asshole men who wrote and translated the bible what's even the difference?), who violet is specifically modeled after in w&b. further it's about giving anything beyond reason in service of earthly pleasure, which violet has had done to her and engaged in herself--greed is her worst sin. *i'd sell my soul, my self-esteem, a dollar at a time. one chance, one kiss, one taste of you my magdalena*. t
- *comfortably numb*, pink floyd
	- the quintessential stelmaria/violet song. she doesn't do emotions, ever. she'll use any method necessary to cushion herself from them and provide the distance required for her to keep fillings her lungs with air. drugs, booze, diq, food, and in this particular case--heavy dissociation--anytime a touchy topic/memory/altercation goes down. *okay just a little pinprick. there'll be no more {**ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh**} but you may feel a little sick*. dealing with rose's death means not actually dealing with it at all. zoning out, hearing static, denial denial denial will all work and do. *there is no pain, you are receding. a distant ship, smoke on the horizon. you are only coming through in waves. your lips move but i cant hear what you're saying.* t
## [[01 inbox/felix\|01 inbox/felix]]
- *i wanna be yours*, arctic monkeys
	- *secrets i have held in my heart are harder to hide than i thought*. bro wants to be her electric meter and her ford cortina because he won't ever rust. particularly cute because the prevalence of [[06 concepts/the forging of metals\|rust]] in this universe makes him never doing as such particularly valuable. t
- *sugar*, sleep token
	- *i've developed a taste for you now sugar*. this song makes me pregnant, therefore it's a fel song. t
- *choke*, i don't know how but they found me
- *whose ready for tomorrow*, ibdy and rat boy
- *do it all the time*, i don't know how but they found me
	- we're talomg over the world one kiss at a time and then i'm taking your girl and i'm making her mine. *fel's fuck you to the ceo*
- *panther like a panther*, run the jewels
	- felix is the shit. *i refuse to play humble as though my dick itty-bitty. i got banana dick, your bitch go apeshit if she hit it.* all the girls love him (he goes down). *drank alcohol for the demons, sip lean with all of the schemers. you see he groove with the people, move with the mind of a genius. you see, he workin' the angles so he ain't never an angel. they wanna get you to hang him; well, give them fuckers a finger*. loved by everyone who knows him, and he knows everyone. *welcome to fuck-you-palooza, we bruising any who moving. who wanna stand for these douches? you raise a hand and you lose it. i hold the door for old ladies, run into fires to save babies.* he does what's right--and murders the shit out of people who don't. *i'm a percert, a poet; i ain't a saint and i know it. been a crook and cooked the books but never shorted no whores. promoters comp me the moet, i'm the man and i know it. i'm the shit, bitch, tell me, how could i not show it?* t

## miscellaneous
## rose
- *anything like me*, poppy
	- *you'll never be anything like me. you shouldn't be anything like me.* t
- *the noose*, a perfect circle
	- a song about an addict having 'sucessfully' gone through the twelve steps and become better and changed--and the people who remember the horrible things they did before they got help. the implication is that the addict hasnt become better or changed at all but has just deluded themself into thinking they're better than everyone else. rose's apotheosis killed everything about her that violet ever loved, and ever loved violet in return. rose feels she's moved beyond petty material shit and been shaped into a new god by the ceo. *now with heaven's help you've cast your demons out.* violet misses her actual sister, and thinks none of rose's 'ascension' was worth all the death it's caused. *not to pull your halo down around your neck and tug you off your cloud. but i'm more than just a little curious how you plan to go sbout making your amends to the dead?* *with your halo slipping down to choke you now.* t
## demons
## devil princes
