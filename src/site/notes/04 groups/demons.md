# demons

## overview

Demons are the lesser creatures of the Fallen Flesh's corrupted ecology—short-lived, numerous, and endlessly hungry. Where [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devils]] rule their domains with warped intelligence, demons are the teeming masses beneath them: cannon fodder, test subjects, and a ready food source for anything stronger than themselves.

Most demons live brief, violent lives measured in weeks or months rather than years. They are not mindless—many possess cunning, memory, even rudimentary personality—but they lack the stability and self-control that distinguishes a Devil from its feral kin.

---

## origin

The first demons were born in the moment of the CEO's [[06 concepts/apotheosis\|first apotheosis]].

When he consumed the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|Fallen Flesh]] and tried to absorb its power, he surged with uncontrollable [[06 concepts/flesh warping\|flesh warping]]—nearly tearing himself apart. As he fought to hold his form together, fragments of divine Flesh flew from his body and scattered across the continent. The Third Prophecy calls these "rogue Fleshlings."

Where the fragments landed, they grew. They consumed. They reproduced. The land beneath them warped into living meat, and from that meat, the first demons crawled.

These primordial demons were not created by the [[05 places/the gardens\|Gardens]] or the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|Prodigy Project]]—they predate both. The Gardens were built _near_ pre-existing [[05 places/the demonfields\|demonfields]] to harvest what had already spawned. Later demons may arise through other means (breeding, spontaneous generation from concentrated Flesh, corruption of humans or animals), but the original population traces back to the CEO's moment of weakness.

The [[06 concepts/The CEO's Prophecies#^10ba11\|prophecy]] states they will "consume and grow and reproduce unchecked" until the CEO achieves true godhood. Until then, his control over them remains fickle at best.

## physiology

Demons are creatures of the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|Flesh]], and their bodies reflect that origin. They come in staggering variety—no two demons look exactly alike—but share certain common traits:

**Mutability** — A demon's form is never truly fixed. They can [[06 concepts/flesh warping\|fleshwarp]] their own bodies: growing spikes, sprouting additional limbs, hardening skin to diamond or softening it to near-liquid. This ability is _limited to their own flesh_ and requires recent feeding to fuel.

**Hunger** — Demons must consume to survive and to use their powers. Feeding on ordinary animals or humans provides some sustenance. Feeding on other demons is better. Feeding on raw Flesh—the substance of the Fallen itself—is best of all, granting significant power boosts.

**Instability** — Most demons struggle to maintain coherent form and mind over time. Without regular feeding, they degrade. Even well-fed demons tend toward eventual dissolution or madness, which is why so few live long enough to become something greater.

## powers

### flesh warping (self only)

The baseline demon ability. They reshape their own bodies according to need or whim—weapons, armor, sensory organs, locomotion. The more recently they've fed (and the better the meal), the more dramatic the transformations they can manage.

Unlike Devils or the CEO, demons cannot fleshwarp _other_ creatures. Their power extends only to the boundaries of their own skin.

### emotional/mental manipulation

An extension of fleshwarping principles: the brain is just another organ made of meat. Demons can exert influence over the minds of weaker creatures—inducing fear, hunger, lust, or blind rage.

This ability varies wildly between individuals. Some demons are little more than beasts with claws. Others are insidious manipulators who prefer to make prey come to them.

### consumption & absorption

When a demon eats another creature, it doesn't just gain calories—it can absorb traits, memories, even fragments of personality. This is why demon-on-demon cannibalism is so common: it's the fastest path to power.

Eat something with better claws, gain better claws. Eat something that knew the layout of a compound, know the layout yourself. The absorption is imperfect and fades over time without reinforcement, but it's real enough to drive constant predation.

## ecological role

Demons are not merely monsters—they're terraformers.

The concentrated Flesh in the [[05 places/the demonfields\|demonfields]] produces massive atmospheric disturbances called **[[05 places/the demonwastes#the wyrmwinds\|Wyrmwinds]]**. These storms roll out across the [[05 places/the demonwastes\|wastes]] and reshape the atmosphere into something better suited for what the Flesh considers "perfect evolution."

Demons are part of this system. Their endless consumption, their constant fleshwarping, their very existence contributes to the slow transformation of the world. They're not just leftover chaos from the CEO's apotheosis—they're an engine of change, working to remake reality whether anyone wants them to or not.

---

## society (such as it is)

Demons do not build civilizations. They cluster in [[05 places/the demonwastes\|Demon Fields]]—regions so saturated with Flesh that the land itself has become meat, pulsing and alive. These fields are typically ruled by a [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devil]], though the degree of control varies enormously.

Some Devils treat their demons as subjects or soldiers, organizing them into something resembling armies. Others simply let them run wild, enjoying the chaos of constant demon-on-demon slaughter as a kind of entertainment or natural selection.

**Hierarchy within fields:**

- Devils at the apex (always)
- Older/stronger demons beneath them (sometimes lieutenants, sometimes just tolerated)
- The teeming masses below, killing and eating each other in endless churn

Demons have no loyalty except to strength. They follow whoever can hurt them worst, and betray the moment they sense weakness.

---

## language

Demons speak **[[06 concepts/languages#screwtape\|Screwtape]]**—a harsh, guttural tongue used only verbally. There is no written form.

This isn't cultural preference; it's practicality. Most demons don't live long enough to bother learning letters, and few have the patience or mental stability for the process of writing. When written communication is absolutely necessary, literate demons (rare) use [[06 concepts/languages#corporate\|Corporate]], the empire's official tongue.

---

## demons & the empire

The [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|corporate empire of zion]] views demons as resources rather than threats. [[05 places/the gardens\|Gardens]] are deliberately built near Demon Fields for easy access to:

- **Test subjects** for Prodigy Project experiments
- **Raw materials** (demon flesh has useful properties)
- **Controlled threats** to test candidates against
- **Disposal sites** for failed experiments (expel them to the field, let the demons handle cleanup)

Demons occasionally raid franchise territories or attack corporate holdings, but these incursions are managed rather than feared. A demon swarm is dangerous to civilians; it's target practice for anyone with real resources.

The greater concern is always the Devil behind the swarm—demons don't organize on their own.

## open questions

> [!question] TO RESOLVE
> 
> - **Lifespan specifics**: "Gnat-like" is evocative but vague. Days? Weeks? Months? Does it vary by type/feeding?
> - **Reproduction**: Do demons breed? Spawn from the Flesh itself? Both?
> - **Named demons**: Any notable individual demons worth documenting, or are they too short-lived/interchangeable?
> - **Demon Fields without Devils**: Can a field exist in pure chaos without an alpha, or does one always emerge eventually?
> - **Demon types/categories**: Is there any taxonomy, or is every demon essentially unique?
