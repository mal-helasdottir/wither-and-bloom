---

## 🧬 Creation & Experimental Context

- Violet was **not born but grown** by [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] as part of a divine interface program. Her creation was part of a second wave of [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|prodigies]] meant to serve as vessels for divine energy (specifically the essence of the **Fallen Flesh**).
- She is considered the **first stable product** of the program, though she is not without flaws from the CEO’s perspective.
- Her "sister" [[03 people/rose\|rose]] is a twin in genetic and metaphysical terms, though they ultimately diverge in power, allegiance, and transformation.
- Violet is not merely a vessel. She has **agency**, **independent thought**, and a resistance to full indoctrination by [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the Pattern]] or [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]].
- Her ability to resist and redirect divine energy is believed to stem from the influence of **Roz**, who bestowed her the capacity for *Wither and Bloom*.

---

## 🧠 Personality

- Violet is extremely emotionally guarded due to lifelong trauma.
- Prone to withdrawal, hyper-vigilance, and self-effacement in moments of vulnerability.
- Displays autistic-coded behaviors: sensory sensitivity, low eye contact, extreme pattern recognition, internal moral logic system.
- Her sarcasm, occasional coldness, or deadpan delivery often masks extreme compassion and guilt.
- Her wit can be razor sharp, but never cruel to those she loves.

## 🌀 Powers & Divine Mechanics

### [[06 concepts/wither and bloom\|wither and bloom]] (Roz’s Gift)
- Violet can **drain** energy from the living (Wither) and **release** it into others or the world (Bloom).
- This gift is **not derived from the Flesh** or Pattern but is instead Roz’s personal intervention—intended or not, given as an act of chaos, resistance, or curiosity.
- She must **touch** to activate either side of the ability. Internal energy can be stored but becomes volatile if unbalanced.
- Withering is destructive, fast, and draining.
- Blooming is restorative, often emotional, and difficult for her at first.
- Only later does she discover she can Bloom others—not just herself—and this changes her relationship to power entirely.

### Other Traits
- Exceptional stealth, combat efficiency, and environmental adaptability.
- Immune to many effects that warp or corrupt humans (due to her origin and possible Roz-granted immunity).
- Has a latent bond to Roz that may allow subtle or unconscious magical resistance to the Pattern’s recursive influence.

## ❤️ Key Relationships

### [[03 people/felix\|felix of jericho]]
- Her equal, her contrast, her opposite, her partner.
- They start as strangers in a warzone and end as twin orbiting stars—always pulled toward one another.
- He is the **first person to treat Violet’s body as *hers***—not as property, not as a weapon, not as a sacred object.
- Their sexual relationship is tender, reverent, and *feral in worshipful ways*.
- Felix sees Violet’s pain and never flinches. He holds her while she breaks and never asks her to be anything other than what she is.
- He is not afraid of her power—he is in love with her because of it.

### [[03 people/the diminished one\|roz]]
- Roz protects her—not out of benevolence, but amusement and anti-Pattern alignment.
- Gifted her the power of Wither and Bloom, possibly as a joke or test of entropy.
- May see Violet as a favored agent, a walking contradiction, or the final proof that chaos is superior to recursion and flesh.

### [[03 people/rose\|rose]]
- Twin, mirror, tragedy. Rose did not resist the CEO’s programming.
- Their fates are entwined by design and sabotage.
- Violet mourns what Rose became, and that grief never fully leaves her.

---

## 🎭 Symbolic and Thematic Roles

- **Violet is what happens when a god-weapon refuses to kill.**
- She is **the counterpoint to empire**—not through revolution, but through compassion, survival, tenderness, and refusal.
- Her ability is a metaphor for processing trauma: you *wither*, you *bloom*, and if you’re lucky, you choose who gets to see you whole.
- Violet is not chosen by fate. She **chooses herself**, again and again.

---

## 🛠️ Additional Notes

- Her immunity to the full effects of LN (Liquid Night) has not yet been explained. It may relate to Roz’s protection or to an internal metabolizing system built by the CEO’s researchers.
- Though engineered, Violet is **not soulless**. Her humanity is real, and it is her refusal to become a monster that defines her arc.
- She is the only one known to successfully stabilize both *Wither* and *Bloom* without mutating.

## personality
### possible diagnoses:
- avoidant personality disorder, "the hedgehog's dilemma"
- autism spectrum disorder
- post traumatic stress disorder, following rose's death
### negative traits:
- stubborn
- pessimistic
- self-loathing
### positive traits:
- empathetic
- stubborn

violet, while genetically and spiritually rose's twin, is considered the black sheep and elevated to second purely for her strong connection with rose. of course there's also her ability to fight for extended periods with makeshift weapons from melee or range, with cover or without, and even accomplish assassinations, espionage, and other high stealth ops.

there are a number of quirks to her personality, a result of being raised as an experiment amongst other experiments rather than as a child with a loving family.
- instant distrust if your name has an even number of syllables
	- magical thinking with shades of ocd/anxiety
- zealous attachment and protectiveness of anything considered *wrong* or *broken*
	- this is empathy as these things are extensions of or stand ins for herself
- expects criticism, demeaning remarks, and punishment over small infractions to be a matter of course
	- high tolerance for pain, mistreatment, and abuse
- struggles with expressing intense emotion in healthy ways
	- disassociation
	- depression
	- anger
	- substance abuse
	- withdrawal/avoidance
- yearns for intimacy, love, and companionship as an equal but cannot understand or uphold the tenants that such a relationship requires
	- sex is meaningless other than as a transaction or bargaining chip
	- believes she is unworthy and undeserving of care
	- anyone spending a lot of time with her is only after something they want
