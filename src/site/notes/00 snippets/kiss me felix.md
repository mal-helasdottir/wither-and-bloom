# kiss me felix
#snippet #waifu 

"Kiss me, Felix."

An arc of the fine liquor leaps from his mouth into the campfire. The resulting heat dries his throat something fierce, which doesn’t help the coughing fit. 

"Wha?" He manages finally, everything inside his chest on fire but he can’t tell if it’s alcohol or something else.

"Kiss me," she commands.

Felix applies a fresh coat of his trademarked smirk, pleased he heard her correctly, "Already kissed ya, doll. Ya ‘member don’t ya?"

She huffs, annoyed, "Not like that! Not all shitty for an escape…"

*Shitty? An here a gentlemüte thought he’d planted a good one…* Certainly shut her up for a moment at the time, not that he looked back on it with pride or anything.

Her eyes flick to the old movie clippings pasted all over the yute’s cabin and her cheeks darken. "A kiss like how real people kiss."

*Real people*, meaning not them. Not playthings or mutant filth. He’d be offended but the sweet blush is too alluring. He slinks closer, pitching his already husky voice lower, into the range of pillow talk, "An how do real people kiss exactly? How’s it different than what we did before?"

He can feel the heat of her compact little body. Watches goosebumps spread over her skin and suit both as he hooks a finger beneath her chin and tilts her face, fixing his eyes on hers. "Was it *feeling*? Not enough heat for ya?"

She smells of myrrh and her big eyes close obligingly as he leans ever closer, lips ghosting against her own. "Ya wanna be romanced maybe? Want the candlelight and the whispered confessions during secret meetings?  Do ya have a need to *yearn*?"

Her breath catches and she sighs against his mouth, the soft noise elevating his pulse to an endless roar in his ears. How does something so innocent make him want to do terrible, wicked, downright sinful things to her. *With her?*

He growls against her, moving the hand beneath her chin to the back of her head to pull her even closer.

"Too bad ol’ Felix doesn’t do any of that nonsense." Releasing her abruptly, he stares into the fire. "This is the real world, bud. Nobody has time for that."

She goes rigid and silent, looking away and pinching her lips together as if to keep from speaking. An uncomfortable pause stretches between them while he watches the leaping flames.

"You absolute—"

Her thought remains unfinished as he’s on her again, this time with no hesitation, his tongue in her mouth seeking the taste of her exasperation.

She responds in kind, fisting her small hands in his hair and pressing her breasts into him. He needs more and pulls her by the waist, expecting at least a token resistance but encountering none at all. Sliding into his lap, her arms circle him beneath the tattered old coat. The myrrh scent of her fades away, replaced by one of unmistakable desire.

"An absolute what?" he kneads her ass as he asks, pleased at the whimper that escapes her.

"You—" she manages before he cuts her off again, sealing his mouth over hers and getting a delicious moan for his trouble.

He leaves off with her ass and instead works his fingers around to the front where the hottest part of her rubs sinfully on the hardness tenting his pants and finds… Skin. Hot, wet, sweet, *bare* skin. 

The suit. The suit she controls with her thoughts. The suit grafted to her spine. It’s thinned so much there’s hardly any barrier at all, like touching her through fine nylon.

He runs his thumb down the front, her hard clit rolling beneath the pressure. She squirms, breathless and he watches her nipples harden, again through the strategically thinned suit.

Waste not, want not.

His mouth settles upon a breast and his tongue runs across the swelling as she bucks hard for friction.

"Felix—" she breathes.

Oh he’ll give her friction.

Forefinger and thumb press her clit from either side, letting gentle pressure build as he works his hand up and down and around. Her own hands find the buckle of his pants and frantically scrabble at opening the mechanism, like a starving wild animal presented with food just beyond the pen door.

Then she has it and she’s got her fingers wrapped around him tight and it’s so good it’s fucking heaven and he nearly spends right there.

But she goes first.

Her eyes close again as her mouth falls open, back arching, muscles tensing and he watches—he can’t stop watching she’s so beautiful and he did that to her he did that he made her cum and fuckkk he wants to cum too he wants to cum so bad.

She works her hands one last time and he does, trembling something fierce, clutching her hard to him like he might die if she pulls away, ignoring the mess between them as he spasms in pleasure again and again, murmuring her name into the onyx waves of her hair as if praying.

"What happened? What did you do to me?" 

Her mouth against his throat makes it a bit difficult to understand, and a little more difficult to focus but he gets there in the end.

"Did you not want sex? I would have stopped if—?"

"No, sex is fine… I mean…" She bites her lip, demure and flushed, "It was like I had a seizure or something? That’s never happened before."

He stares. "You’ve never cum before? Never had an orgasm?"

"Is that what it was? I’ve seen other people do it but I didn’t think I could. I had no idea it felt like that…"

Her mouth presses softly against his. It makes his heart ache. 

"What did you think? Was it—?"

"It was nice," she whispers, smiling into his mouth. "Could I have another?"

"I’ve created a monster." He chuckles, picking her up and kicking sand over the fire in one movement. "Inside, not here," he says, heading toward the open yute where the old prints still rattle in the breeze.
