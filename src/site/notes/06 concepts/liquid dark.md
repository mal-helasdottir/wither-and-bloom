Anything made of steel or metal can be made from LD200 instead, it is more easily molded and shaped while in liquid form since, unlike metal it doesn't have to be super heated, but rather a special chemical substance is added to its liquid state and then charged with an electric current, which causes LD200 harden like metal.  It cannot be remelted unless manipulated by a Fleshwarper.  Devil skin also absorbs LD200. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | construction | Primary LN/LD Formulations |

Anything made of steel or metal can be made from LD200 instead, it is more easily molded and shaped while in liquid form since, unlike metal it doesn't have to be super heated, but rather a special chemical substance is added to its liquid state and then charged with an electric current, which causes LD200 harden like metal.  It cannot be remelted unless manipulated by a Fleshwarper.  Devil skin also absorbs LD200.                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                       |
