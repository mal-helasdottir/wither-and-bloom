OK so Devils are all early versions of [[03 people/violet\|violet]] and [[03 people/rose\|Rose]]. [[03 people/the ceo\|The CEO]]'s failed experiments to create the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|protege]].

They were all at once point lab grown Children with the CEO's DNA and genetic manipulations in attempts to create a human host capable of holding the full might of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]'s godly power.

[[03 people/the ceo\|The CEO]]'s ultimate desire is to be able to retain both his own mind and his human form. its very much a hubris thing more than anything. he has already (mostly) held onto his mind (in large part due to the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|FF]] being brain dead but he doesn't know that) but he can't hold that tenuous grasps on his sanity with out like randomly fleshwarping into a monster or losing his grip on the power and basically exploding, which is why he has to devote like 98% of his godly powers to just keeping himself held together.

He created [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|the prodigy project]] to grow a body capable of holding the power while maintaining its form and his plan is to then take over that body and be the "perfect form" (in his mind.)

Well he has been at it a while. and each time has gotten a little better. As he raises these kids though he will have them consume various things to test their control. animals, other normal people, mutants, various types of [[06 concepts/liquid dark\|Liquid night]] possibly, as well as demons. And when he thinks they are ready or when he grows impatient he will send them the final test.

- A piece of his own flesh that contains a portion of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]'s direct power, which he refers to as a "[[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|Sliver of Divinity]]."

Until [[03 people/rose\|Rose]], every one of his children who consumed this [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|Sliver of Divinity]] would either immediately or very quickly Flesh Warp into a monster; no longer human. A failure in the CEO's eyes. They often experienced fits of insanity as well and tended to kill most inhabitants in the [[05 places/the gardens\|Garden]] before they could be expelled into a [[05 places/the demonwastes\|Demon Field]] (This is one of various reasons why Gardens of built near DFs in addition to having access to demons to study etc).

These Children became the Devils of those fields at this point. some of the later versions fleshwarped less and might still look closer to human, other regain some of their sanity and can be spoken to and reasoned with. the earlier ones (like Cerberus) remain mostly unfeeling rage beast like many demons are but way stronger and more powerful because they have a part of god inside them.

- I think the Devils manipulate the fields and the [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] in them to warp the environment and the creatures their to reflect themselves. Gluttony is constantly raining shit and blood and all the beasties there are eternally hungry because Cerberus is. (I also think Cerberus may have been an experiment where they had both twins or maybe even triplets eat the [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|sliver]] at once rather than only the strongest of the batch and when they flesh warped together forming the three headed beastie and making them even less coherent. but that is just minor thought and aside) .

So here was my thinking on the "horcrux" idea that I have shared before but will put it all in once place right now.

The CEO, in his hubris, has laid the seeds for his own downfall within his failed experiments. He is taking a portion of his own godly power and placing it in other beings. This does slightly weaken him, but not that much really. Alone these Slivers of Divinity are no where near enough to face him. The Devils are too uncontrollable on their own to really unite against him as well, any alliance between Devils would be rife with betrayal and back stabbing most likely since they are all a little bit insane even the more sane ones. But if someone where to go around and collect all these Slivers and were able to hold them in one body this person might stand a chance against the CEO. Even if they couldn't out right kill him, they may be able to press him enough to where he is unable to fight back while also devoting enough of his own power to keep himself from exploding. (Which is what the grand final battle will be. [[03 people/violet\|violet]] will have several slivers in her, and [[03 people/felix\|felix]] will be given a sword or something (possibly from the lanky boys or the [[04 groups/the brotherhood of gnosis\|Brotherhood]]) that can hurt the CEO and the two of them basically wear him down until he can't hold himself together anymore. or at least that was my thought).

So that was my original "horcrux" idea. its a bit different from like HP in that rather than the mcguffin like being what keeps him alive, its more like a power up for [[03 people/violet\|violet]] making her just a little be more of a match for him, and when combined with the weapon [[03 people/felix\|felix]] gets they can defeat him or at least get him to blow up.

ADDENDUM: this would imply that at least one or two [[05 places/the gardens\|gardens]] were not built near a field because they would have been built before that connection was sussed out

yes i think the first one wasn't and it was a big problem.

like the CEO himself had to intervene. or maybe there was a child that he had to kill and it pushed him harder than he liked so he decided from then on they would be built near DFs and when the devil was made they would push it into the field in the hopes that the [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] there would kill it. instead the devil became alpha shit, but it wasn't bothering him any more so he was like "jorbs done!"

ADDENDUM 2: Devils (not [[04 groups/demons\|demons]]), how do the…

⁠do you think the seeding (ew) of himself across the princes is a conscious decision on his part? like it was for voldemort? or do you think its an unintended side effect of perhaps a powerplay to gain more control over the fields? and then would he even be aware it weakens him or no?

- I think it is unintended. He is a fucking CEO made god. Do you think Elon Musk has enough awareness to realize when he is actively hurting himself with is idiot ploys? nah cuz too many people worship him. Our CEO is that on crack. everything he does is the correct move because how could it not be.

- if he's so busy trying not to wash apart in a tidal wave of blood and fat perhaps he registers that loss of his power as reassertion of control over his own form--a smaller power base within him would be easier to control right? that's just math.

- like anyone can be emperor over a small closet, but being an emperor of the world is a different matter altogether

- yes, and in his mind this just reaffirms that he is getting STRONGER and making the right calls. but really its cuz he is weakening himself which makes it easier for him to hold onto the power since there is actively less of it there.

perhaps without realizing it he's turning his world into a closet and then gloating over how smerter he is
