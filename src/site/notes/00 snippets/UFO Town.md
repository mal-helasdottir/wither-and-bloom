# UFO Town
#snippit #husbando


There was next to nothing to see in the badlands.  They had left Winne behind at a place Felix called Cas Apach; when she asked what that meant he shrugged and pointed to the remains of a sign marking the entrance to the joint.  Most of the letters had fallen from it so that only “Cas” and “Apach” remained.

He said they would take the car from here, it would get them there much faster and navigate the streets of UFO town better than Winne would. And set about unhooking it from its trailer.

He wasn’t wrong about the speed, but she did miss the space she had in the motorhome.  The back of hatchback had its rear seats removed and replaces with various supplies, cobbled together devices, spare parts and weapons, including the overlarge  demon tooth spear.  This meant she was crammed into the front seat next to him, and worse that thing Roswell had found a spot in her lap.   It laid down and seemed to be sleeping, but she would occasionally see its third eye open to look at her as they traveled.  At one point she found herself absently stroking the creatures soft fur but stopped herself when she realized what she was doing.

The drive was very dull.  They were far enough away from Gluttony at this point that the sky was mostly blue with only a slight greenish tinge at its edges. Even Felix had run out of things to point out to her and as the drive carried on she found he could be silent… mostly.  He would still perk up when certain songs would begin to play over the cars speakers and he would sing off key along with them, often prefacing it with “Oh this is a good one!” and turning the volume up enough that the bass would rattle the vehicle and its contents.

After they passed a rusted green sign that had been spray painted over to read UFO town 10 miles. He turned down the radio and pulled to the side of the road.  Ahead she could see the beginnings of the buildings that made up the town.  A collection of old world ruins repurposed and rebuilt with ramshackle supplies.

Felix cut the engine.  He sat silent for several seconds the only sound being the occasional creak and tick of contracting metal bits as the engine cooled.  She was ready to ask him what they were waiting for when he turned to her.

“When we get into to town I’m goin’ ta need ya to do what I tell ya.  This ain’t a Mute town and It certainly ain’t no Corpo town.  The people here are… odd. An I wouldn’t be comin’ here if I didn’t need these bolts I’m owed.”

She wasn’t sure what he meant fully but bristled at the idea of taking more of his orders, and this obsession with ‘bolts’ was working her nerves.  
“I thought we were going some place to get help with finding rose…” She folds her arms across her chest, her lips forming a defiant thin line.

“We are goin ta do that, I told ya we would, but after I get my bolts.  We will need em ta hire trackers a# titlend ta squeeze the info brokers.”

She was unconvinced. "I fail to see how these *bolts* you want will help us.  Surely any *tracker* or *info broker* would want corporate marks of credit for their service, and any true citizen should be honored to help me and my sister when the circumstances are explained.  Rose is the *prodigy* after all."

Felix's' tail twitches uncomfortably with annoyance against the car seat.  "I just told ya this ain't no corpo town.  Creds and scrip ain't hardly worth the paper they is printed on out in the waste.  Also people here are more likely ta think yer crazier than a black blood on a bender if ya start sayin yer lookin' fer the prodigy or are her sister. "

"Then why are we here?  We should be going to a proper franchise or better yet Zion itself!  If you take me there you will be rewarded I'm sure! " 

He grits his sharp teeth and speaks between them, "We been through this already buttercup they would kill me just fer havin' ya no matter what we tell em.  You didn't see how they were in that *garden* of yers they were killin' everyone that weren't already dead I'm not convinced they wouldn't have killed you too."

She narrows her eyes and her lower lip juts out the perfect image of petulance, "I don't agree. If I can explain to them..."

He cuts her off with a frustrated grunt, "I ain't takin' that chance! We need ta find Rose first.  If she really IS the *prodigy* then only her word can save us from yer people, so we are goin ta find her *My way* an my way needs cold hard nuts an bolts, and that,"  He points to rebuilt ruins ahead of them, "is where we get 'em."  He turns in his seat facing his body more towards her his face and voice softening, "An that place is dangerous, the people there ain't mine and they certainly aint yers, but its our best bet ta get what we need to find yer Rose."

She throws her head back purposely looking away from this infuriating creature beside her.  Roswell who had been watching the argument with some interest from her spot in Violet's lap tilts her head in Felix's direction two of her large red eyes remain fixed on him while the third keeps close watch on the underside of Violet's chin.

"Look Vi yer a *eel outta the aquifier* here, I just need ya to do what I tell ya so we can get this done then go about findin' yer sister."

She stares out the window for a long moment before her shoulders relax slightly and she turns back to him.  "Fine. But once this is done we waste no more time. We go strait to these *trackers* of yours, every moment wasted is another my sister is in danger."

He sighs with a measure of relief.  "Deal, but I need ya to promise me you will do what I say in here."

Her eyes narrow again dangerously she senses a trick but sees no other option with out wasting more time arguing.  She won't blindly follow his orders no matter what she swears or promises, but if it will get them moving towards rose she will placate him.  For now.  So, she crosses the fingers of her left hand hidden beneath her folded arms before saying, "I promise."

Lanky towns never quite sat right with Felix.  The whole vibe was always just slightly... strange.  UFO town was no different.  As the car pulled off the highway and started to coast between the repurposed buildings there were no organized check points like you might find in a corpo town and no mute sherriff signaling you to pull over so he can introduce himself and tell you the way of things, but rather you were greeted with closed doors and flipped signs.  The slower folk you might catch a glimpse of as they lowered the blinds or silently beckoned in their playing children off the street, but you were more likely to see the mechanical gaze of cameras that followed your progress as you passed. 

The people that lived here could almost pass as run of the mill human, but their limbs were just a little too long or their skin a little to grey.  Their eyes slightly too large and their nose too small.  The effect made their heads seem too large even when they weren't.  The more glimpse you caught of the retreating populous the more obvious it was that these people were only mostly human.  What the other part was Felix didn't quite know.  Mutes were obviously not fully human with their animalistic features; feathers, fur, claws and scales were honest in their anti-humanity. Lanky folk were sometimes uncanny valley writ large. 

"I thought you said this wasn't a mutant town?" Violet asked as her eyes followed the progress of a child with a reverse set of thumbs on their hands being ushered inside by their mother.

"It ain't... they aint mutes."

Felix turned the car down a side street, hoping he could remember how to get to the rendezvous.  The last thing he wanted to do was to get lost in a Lanky town. 

"They don't look like normal humans though... wouldn't that make them mutants?"

He stopped himself from laughing at the thought of anything in the world being *normal* and settled for a toothy grin in her direction.  

"Yeah they ain't human either... My boy Cid says they are called Annuks or Ankai or somethin' like that most of us call 'em the Lanky folk."

He was desperately watching for signs of the way to go at this point and was worried he might have missed a turn when he finally spotted the building he was looking for.
