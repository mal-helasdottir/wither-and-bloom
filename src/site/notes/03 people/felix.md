## üìú BACKSTORY

Felix was born in **Jericho**, the military-industrial stronghold of the Empire of Zion, to a mutant soldier and a domestic servant.

His **father**, Alex (`4374A7`), was a formidable gladiator who served for years in the corpo arenas. So dangerous and popular was his fighting record that he was **granted semi-retirement** ‚Äî an exceedingly rare honor for m√ºte soldiers. Even then, he was regularly summoned back for exhibition fights under the assumption he would eventually be killed for sport.

His **mother**, Nikki (`5826N3`), was a cook and servant in the home of **Brigadier General Quintas Valens**, the same officer who oversaw Jericho‚Äôs gladiator program. It was Nikki who ensured Felix was not entirely illiterate: in a world where m√ºtes were trained to fight and die without understanding the language of their captors, she taught him to read and count.

Felix was raised on the **military track**, like most m√ºte boys. He excelled in combat, and might have been selected for **MOT (Mutant Officer Training)** had it not been for his **chronic insubordination**. He spent his youth in and out of **the brig**, but earned respect among his peers for **protecting those he considered kin**.

Eventually, **Valens pulled him from the disciplinary system and placed him in the arena**, likely as a calculated move to profit from his skill. Felix complied. He became one of the most **successful pit fighters** in Jericho‚Äôs circuit. He **tried not to kill**, reserving lethal force for when he had no other choice ‚Äî unless his opponent was cruel, in which case he showed no mercy.

The fight that changed his life was the one against his father. He was ordered to fight him publicly. **Felix killed his father in the arena.**

Afterward, he and Nikki fled Jericho. The corpos retaliated.

They enacted a **targeted cleansing of Jericho**, **executing every mutant in the city within a specific age bracket**‚Äîchildren and teenagers like Felix. They were wiped out to prevent further disobedience, escape, or uprising.

Felix is the **only known survivor** of this purge.
