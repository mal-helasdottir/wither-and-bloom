# Ancient Times and Old Gods

- ???? - The Infinite Pattern and The Fleshwarper begin their eternal war
- ???? - The Maw of Chaos joins the war.
- ???? - The Infinite Pattern strikes a killing blow against the Fleshwarper scattering its remains throughout the cosmos.
	- The Maw of Chaos is caught in the attack and sundered into two halves.  
- ???? - The Infinite Pattern begins its long slumber in the depths of far space to recover and prepare for the Fleshwarper’s inevitable return.
- ~3.7 billion years ago (BYA) - A part of the Fallen Flesh impacts with earth. It is a skull fragment featuring a myriad of eye sockets.
	- Life starts to appear shortly after this. A forest eventually forms around the skull fragment.  Most fauna instinctively avoided the skull.
- ~2.6 BYA - The Infinite Pattern briefly rouses to establish watch points throughout the universes near locations parts of the Fallen Flesh has landed. His followers are to keep vigil as it returns to its slumber.
	- The Hexagon on Saturn forms, which serves as the Pattern’s watch point in our star system.
	- The Acolytes of the Pattern come through the Hexagon and establish colonies on Titan, Callisto, Mars, and Venus.  They also establish a military style observation point inside earths moon after hollowing it out.
- ~68 million years ago (MYA)- A Carchatodontosaurs in the late Cretaceous period was chasing prey through a dense rainforest when the large theropod stepped on a shard of the Fallen Flesh’s skull bone.  A fragment became lodged int he creatures foot which grew infected. By the time it died most of its skin had turned black and it had grown several extra eyes.  Scavengers ate the corpse of the theropod and they too became infected with the flesh.  It begins to slowly spread throughout the dinosaurs in the region like a cancer.
	- The cancerous Flesh begins spreading beyond the jungle of its origin and the Fallen Flesh experiences a glimmer of awareness.  
	- The Acolytes soon notice the anomalies and launch an asteroid at the Earth causing the extinction of the dinosaurs and returning the Flesh full to death.
	- The Fallen Flesh’s skull fragment is displaced by the impact and ends up in a deep oceanic trench that would one day be part of the Gulf of Mexico
- ~2.8 MYA - One half of the Sundered Chaos, who will eventually become known as The Diminished One reaches earth.
	- The Acolytes mark the Diminished One’s arrival, but their directive is related to that of the Flesh and so they only observe it and do not interfere or disturb the pattern about it.
	- The Homo Habilis makes its first appearance around this time.
