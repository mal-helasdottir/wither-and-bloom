# the demonwastes

---

## overview

The **Demonwastes** are the vast stretches of middle America rendered uninhabitable during and after [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]]. Irradiated, poisoned, and twisted by forces beyond comprehension, these lands are avoided by anyone with sense. The environment is hostile, resources are scarce, and worse things than weather wait in the deep places.

The wastes are distinct from [[05 places/the wilds\|the wilds]]—while the wilds are merely lawless and dangerous, the wastes are _wrong_. The land itself resists human presence. Those who travel through do so quickly, quietly, and with full awareness that they may not emerge.

Within the broader wastes lie the [[demonfields\|demonfields]]: nine concentrated zones where the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|Fallen Flesh]] has taken root and spread, saturating the land until the earth itself becomes meat. These are the domains of [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devils]], and they are the source of everything that makes the wastes deadly.

## origin

The Demonwastes were born in the moment of the CEO's [[06 concepts/apotheosis\|first apotheosis]].

When he consumed the Fallen Flesh and tried to absorb its power, he surged with uncontrollable [[06 concepts/flesh warping\|flesh warping]]—nearly tearing himself apart. As he fought to hold his form together, fragments of divine Flesh flew from his body and scattered across the continent. These fragments became seeds.

Where they landed, they grew. They consumed. They reproduced. The land beneath them warped into living meat, and from that meat, the first [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] crawled. The corruption spread outward from these seeds, poisoning the surrounding territory into the wastes we know today.

The [[03 people/the ceo\|CEO]]'s own prophecies refer to these spawn as "rogue Fleshlings"—technically his, born from his moment of weakness, but beyond his direct control. The Third Prophecy states they will "consume and grow and reproduce unchecked" until he achieves true godhood. Until then, his dominion over them remains fickle at best.

## the wyrmwinds

The wastes are not passive. They _breathe_.

The concentrated Flesh in the [[demonfields\|demonfields]] produces massive atmospheric disturbances called **Wyrmwinds**—storms of unknown composition that roll out across the wastes and beyond. These storms are actively terraforming the world, reshaping the atmosphere into something better suited for what the Flesh considers "perfect evolution."

For those caught in a Wyrmwind without shelter, the results vary from mutation to dissolution to worse things that don't have names.

**Official propaganda** frames the Wyrmwinds as holy cleansing storms sent to purify the sinful wastes. The faithful are instructed to shelter and pray when one approaches—those caught in the storm clearly had sin in their hearts. The truth is simpler and worse: the storms don't discriminate. They're just doing what Flesh does. Growing.

## ecology & hazards

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT
> 
> - What lives in the wastes _between_ fields? Mutated wildlife? Lesser demons that wandered out? Scavengers?
> - Environmental hazards beyond Wyrmwinds: radiation pockets, Flesh-tainted water, atmospheric toxins?
> - Are there any resources worth scavenging, or is it purely a zone to cross?

## navigation & travel

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT
> 
> - How do people cross the wastes? Known safe(r) paths? Guides?
> - Do smugglers and runners have routes that avoid the worst of it?
> - Is there any infrastructure—old highways, landmarks, caches?
> - How close can you get to a field before it's too late?

## the wastes and the empire

The [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|corporate empire of zion]] views the Demonwastes as a managed buffer rather than territory worth reclaiming.

**Strategic value**: [[05 places/the gardens\|Gardens]] are deliberately built at the edges of the wastes, near [[demonfields\|demonfields]], for easy access to demons (test subjects), raw Flesh (materials), and a convenient dumping ground for failed experiments. The wastes themselves serve as a natural barrier—no army is marching through that.

**Propaganda**: The official line frames the wastes as land stained by "the Sins of the old world." Only the CEO can call the demons to heel and eventually cleanse the corruption. The masses are taught to fear the wastes and trust the empire's protection.

**Actual control**: The CEO _can_ assert dominance over demons and Devils—they're made from his flesh, after all. But maintaining that control requires active effort he can't spare while also holding himself together. The Third Prophecy promises this will change when he achieves true godhood. Until then, the wastes remain semi-autonomous horrors at the edge of his empire.

## open questions

> [!question] TO RESOLVE
> 
> - **Borders**: Where do the wastes end and normal wilds begin? Is it gradual or sharp?
> - **Expansion**: Are the wastes growing? Stable? Can territory be reclaimed?
> - **Population**: Does anyone _live_ in the wastes permanently? Hermits, exiles, the desperate?
> - **Pre-Revelation remnants**: What old-world infrastructure remains? Cities? Highways?
