# anunnaki
- The Annunnaki are an extra terrestrial race from an unknown star system that is 1000s of light years away from our own.  
	- They are roughly humanoid in shape, but are much taller and their limbs over long and thin.
	- Their hands have an extra thumb on its bottom giving them six digits, and the fingers are much longer and have extra joins compared to human hands.
	- Their heads are over large by human standards and they have large eyes that are mostly back, but glow with and inner light in various colors.  They have eyelids that close from the sides rather than the tops.
	- They have no visible ears and their nose is under developed (by human standards) and is simply two slits.  These nose slits allow them to smell, but also house a set of auditory organs
	- Their mouths are small and lipless.  They do not speak as they evolved to communicate telepathically, so they have no tongue in their mouths. Their mouths are primarily used for eating and drinking, and they tend to prefer liquid diets as they do not develop or need much muscle mass. 
	- 
	- Their legs are double jointed like an animals hind legs might be and their feet end in paired gripping claws. 
	- Their skin is thicker and more leathery than human skin and tends to come in shades of Grey, from a pallid white to near ebony.  The mid tones tend to be blue or purplish in hue.
	- their blood is black blue in color.
	- They are not very physically strong, but rather rely heavily on their telekinetic abilities to augment their strength.
	- Their home world has much lower gravity than the earth, so they are better suited for lower G environments, and those that do live on or visit the earth are reliant on cybernetic augmentations and/or their telekinesis to move.
