# apotheosis

the [[06 concepts/cannibalism\|consumption]] of god parts or whole gods in order to become a god (i.e. a being of similar power level and abilities as an [[04 groups/The Eldest Ones\|elder]])

## what is *apotheosis*?

Apotheosis is a **singular, deliberate act** undertaken **only** by hand-selected, lab-created candidates within the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|prodigy project]]. It is the final trial in a long chain of biological, psychological, and metaphysical preparation.

To undergo apotheosis, a candidate must:

- Be created and raised within a [[05 places/the gardens\|garden]] facility (e.g., Eden)
- Endure prolonged exposure to [[06 concepts/liquid dark\|Liquid Night/Dark (LN)]], often in escalating doses
- Demonstrate extreme physical resilience, obedience, and compatibility
- Be granted access to a [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|sliver of divinity]] — a literal piece of [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]

Apotheosis is the act of [[06 concepts/cannibalism\|consuming]] that sliver.

### What Success Means

A successful apotheosis results in the transformation of the candidate into a **vessel** capable of housing the **soul and consciousness of the CEO**.

This is not a reward.

The candidate will **cease to exist** during this process, overwritten entirely to allow the CEO to:

- Achieve corporeal incarnation
- Defeat or consume the entity known as [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]
- Assume total control over divine and material systems

### What Failure Brings

If the candidate **fails** apotheosis:

- Their body mutates into something monstrous, unstable, and powerful
- Their mind often fractures, breaks, or is replaced entirely
- They are designated a [[04 groups/the devil princes\|devil prince]] and deployed to govern a [[05 places/the demonwastes\|demonfield]]

These failures are not discarded — they are weaponized.

### What Apotheosis Is Not

- Apotheosis is **not** exposure to Liquid Night.
- Apotheosis is **not** mutation from environmental contamination.
- Apotheosis is **not** a universal risk — it is **only** for those the corpo has built and shaped for this purpose.

Any other mutation or enhancement (e.g., müte traits, LN overdose, combat grafts) may result in power, but it is **not apotheosis** — and cannot lead to true elevation.
