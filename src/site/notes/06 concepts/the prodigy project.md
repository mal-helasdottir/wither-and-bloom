# the prodigy project

The Prodigy Project was designed to create a living human capable of hosting the full might of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] with out destroying itself. 

This was done using [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s DNA (this part was pure hubris, any human DNA would work Joshua's DNA is NOT special at all), The Flesh, genetic science and animal/plant Biology to create  this perfect host.  

Joshua's plan was to create this perfect host (that he named the Prodigy) and then have them [[06 concepts/cannibalism\|consume]] him bodily in a manner similar to how he consumed the vestiges of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] to become [[03 people/the ceo\|Adam]]. [[03 people/the ceo\|Adam]] would simultaneously consume the Prodigy.  This would result in the two bodies merging to become one at which point [[03 people/the ceo\|Adam]] would be truly born to his full potential.  

Joshua truly believes that if this plan comes to fruition he will finally be the god he was always destined to be.   The reality probably is if this did happen, and the [[06 concepts/flesh warping\|Flesh Warper]]'s  power was held stably in a living body the god would re-awaken fully and go back to doing what it wants and both Joshua and the Prodigy would cease to exist.

The project has been going on for nearly a century or maybe several decades (open to suggestion here) I think by the time the story starts.  There have been a number of failures.  it takes along time grow and raise children even those born from tubes. 

 So each Attempt featured 4 children.  Two boys and Two Girls.  (we should figure out what happened to the boys in [[03 people/violet\|violet]]'s [[05 places/the gardens\|Garden]].  killed by [[03 people/rose\|rose]]?  if so maybe their bodies have been puppeted too?  They were less stable than [[03 people/rose\|rose]] but were they still stable? hmmm worth thinking about).  

They are all raised and subjected to various experiments (we can think about details)  Their ability to hold Flesh and injest Im sure is one,  can they use the powers with out like any adverse affects.  do they start to mutate or warp at all?  etc. 

The Candidate that does the best is consider the most viable.  These subjects are taken and given what [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] calls a [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|sliver of Divinity]].  Basically a chunk of his own godly flesh.  Usually it is like an eye or a finger or maybe a piece of intestine.  The subject is to devour it.  They always do this willingly because part of their upbringing is preparing them for all this and indoctrinating them in CEO worship and also their own legacy etc.

Many of the kids will die or whatever even before they get to this final test, but a fair number have just like eaten this bit of [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] then exploded.  Other have warped into what are known as Devils.  mad creatures way more powerful than demons with a stronger sense of self and control (Devils and [[04 groups/demons\|Demons]] probably need their own thread).  They tend to kill everyone in the [[05 places/the gardens\|garden]] when this happens, eat most of them for knowledge/power and then relocate to whatever [[05 places/the demonwastes\|demon field]] is closet to them as [[05 places/the gardens\|Gardens]] are often purposely built not too far from demon fields because most people stay away from them and its a ready supply of both [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and flesh that can be gathered for experimentation. These Devils tend to assume control of the field warping it in their image/to their liking and exerting as much or as little control over the demon population within the field as they desire (some might like to just let it be crazy with demon on demon killing etc, while others probably prevent the lesser [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] from doing that sort of thing and treat them like subjects or their own army).
