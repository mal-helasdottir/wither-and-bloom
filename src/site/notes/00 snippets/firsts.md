**battery city, feast of the all-martyr's**
#### *violet* --
there's something about [[03 people/felix\|him]], [[03 people/violet\|she]] thinks, for what must be the twentieth time just today.

something special.

something... she's staring, and he notices. locks eyes with her across the small crowd and the powdery rainbow clouds. he's covered in the colorful particles, they cling to him with a ghostly reverence, as if he's one of the martyred ancestors this entire celebration is for. the idea of fel being martyred hurts somehow, brings a burn to her eyes and pulls the corners of her mouth down.

always the contrarian, fel grins, widening slowly, growing brighter, like daybreak over the wastes. his fangs glitter in battery city's perpetual twilight, and his eyes are dark and deep, fixed on her.

always on her. she can't look away.

he strides over, still grinning in that sly, smug way of his, but she swears she can hear a too-fast pulse beneath the pink spattered cloth of his shirt, beneath the cage of his ribs. though perhaps she's simply hearing her own pulse. it's difficult to say. it's hard to focus. she can smell him too, snowfall and sweat and the LN he coats all his equipment with.

"vi," he says.

"fel," she replies.

"ya need somethin'?" impossibly, his expression becomes smarmier and her stomach does a flopping dance of betrayal. "ya awful clean... i can help with that."

before she can ask what he means, he lobs a hidden handful of bright blue dust in her face and *runs*.

#### *felix* --
she's following him.

he stifles a chuckle. a tail is normally a bad thing, but rather than the usual racing thoughts and pulse, the need to escape, there's a bubbling warmth in his chest and a smile tugging at his lips.

he doesn't bother evading her amongst the crowded festival stalls. instead he chooses to consider the merits of the various foods on offer. does he want a mushroom kebab or a fried meat-o platter with noodles? he lingers at a booth where hard candies glitter at him beneath their smokey ln wrappers. 

what would she like? something savory? protein? how hungry is she? is she hungry? maybe she'd just like a sweet.

she is fond of sweets. he recalls the sparkling eyes and greedy fingers the one time they uncovered a little sweetener in alien town, and he made them each a soft, fried bun sprinkled with the stuff. she'd stolen half of his. he didn't hold it against her.

he settles on a handful of the gem colored candy and a kebab, knowing her occasional reluctance to eat meat and resolving to eat it himself before getting her something else if she desires.

the warmth again. likely hungry. or heartburn.

she's still moving through the edges, a dark needle slipping between the thick weft of mutants at play. her hood is down and her long braid is coated with blue powder, as though she wiped the color off her face with it.

he finds a spot beneath the broad gills of a softly luminescing lilac bonnet and sits, awaiting her inevitable approach.

#### *violet* --
likely, he's noticed her, but she finds the spark of irritation that lead to the chase has sputtered out. now the grilled and spiced kebab in his hand looks almost as appealing as the empty seat beside him.

she slides into the open spot, taking the kebab and brushing her lips softly along his scruffy jaw with a "thanks."

he chuckles. "i was expectin' somethin' a little more violent."

violet sets to work upon her dinner with a noncommittal sort of grunt.

felix leans away, his tail finding her waist, to hand her a cup of some fermented beverage. he has one too and violet watches from the corner of her eye as he lifts it to his lips, throat bobbing with each swallow.

he's fascinating to her. 

she cannot recall when felix moved from *necessary annoyance* to *indispensable partner*. circumstances haven't changed: her father still believes he will become a god; rose is still lost in the wastes somewhere; demons, ankai, and psychopaths prowl relentlessly in search of fulfillment; everything is fucked and no one is safe -- least of all her.

and yet he's here. making sure she eats, sleeps, and knows the right people. in a fight, he's in her blind spots, keeping trouble at bay. right now the solid, slim loop of his tufted tail around her is a tether in a wyrmtempest. comfortable. companionable. she can relax, or at the least the closest she can get to *relaxed*.

it's... nice. violet curls against him as she finishes her dinner, fidgeting with the soft, warm fur beneath her fingertips.

#### *felix* --
his skin heats, a tingle racing up his spine at her gentle touch. he fights to keep his pulse steady and breathing even, covering anything he cant control by popping one of her candies in his mouth. "ya want one?"

she tilts her head and lets her mouth fall open, sticking out her pink tongue in expectation of a sweet.

he could unwrap one and place it on her tongue with reverence the way the corpos do in their holy mysteries. he'd never have to think too deeply about the consequences of feelings unspoken or needs unrequited.

or--

felix presses his mouth to hers, softly, tracing his tongue along her plump bottom lip. his thumb caresses the side of her throat where the skin is smoother than silk. she opens to him with a low murmur and the city fades away to nothing as she tentatively curls her tongue against his own. he groans at the intimate stroke, at the weight of her in his arms. then she steals the candy before he has the chance to slip it to her.

"thief," he grumbles, without heat. 

he doesn't let her go, but then she doesn't pull away either, even as he fishes around in his pocket.

"rogue," she replies, candy clacking against her teeth, fingers knitting over the slopes of his shoulders.

"ya love it though," he says, popping a replacement candy into his mouth.

she just watches him, thoughtful, her eyes wide and beautiful under the soft neon shrooms, the colors reflecting back at him like moonbeams on still water.

he lets the silence hang in the air, interested to see what she does with the reins in her hands.

"kiss me again, felix," she breathes and her voice is so soft and sweet he cannot help but oblige.

once.

twice.

more.

now that he's started he can't stop. the taste of her is liquid night and the headiest absynth. his kisses turn frantic, heavy, greedy, as though he needs his mouth against her to live. his heart flutters as she responds in kind for every groan and every murmur and sigh. he's panting hard, but so is she. her fingers locked into his messy hair. his hands skimming along the curves of her backside.

he wants her close. wants to make her his. wants --

"felix," she manages. 

he places more kisses along the side of her throat as he waits.

"i need you," she says, words ending in a whimper that electrifies his entire body. "i need you to touch me. i need you to--"

another kiss, this time to quiet her.

"sure," he says, leading her by the hand away from the festival and towards the quiet of the rest park. "anythin' ya need." she pads close behind and he pauses for yet another touch of her lips on his own. he's shocked and horrified he managed to live this long without kissing violet senseless. if that can even be called *living*.  "anythin' ya want buttercup. it's yours."

#### *violet* --

every step closer to the winnie brings felix closer to her.

it seems like he won't -- *or can't* -- keep his himself away from her, and she would give anything to ensure he never stops. his big, warm hands with their rough calluses and incongruous gentleness that she's used to seeing cook food, or pet roz, fight with her... bandage her... now trace her curves as if he wants to memorize them, categorize them. fashion her into a special relic only he has he power to build with an unfamiliar set of tools. or a poorly timed flywheel he can coax back into sweetly singing rhythm.

he sets her aflame. makes her alive. settles an ache deep in her belly, a thrumming hollowness she can feel reflected in the way his breaths hitch and his fingers tremble at her kisses. she nibbles on the swell of his bottom lip and he groans, arms tightening to bring her flush to his lean form. 

his lips find the fluttering pulse beneath her ear. his words burn into her skin like a tattoo. "keep on doing that an' we won't make it to a bed, girl." 

she laughs and plants her own kisses along his scruffy jaw, rising up onto her toes to reach. "don't need one. i'm not used to doing this in a bed anyway."

he stares, veridian gaze hard enough to etch glass, a wyrmwind focused just on her. "ya' been done wrong. up ta me to fix it, of course."

suddenly he throws both arms around her, and secures her over his broad shoulder like a sack of concrete.

her yelp is lost amidst his deep chuckles as she squirms, cheeks flaming. "fel--"

"i never say no to a fix. or a challenge. ya can count on ol' fel."

his grip is impossible to evade. no amount of wriggling gets him to relax his hold on her even one bit. if anything, it seems to embolden him as she discovers when he palms the plumpness of her backside, and finishes with a little *smack*.

the heat inside her intensifies. the ache, the hollow yearning thrown further open. all protests vanish, leaving her tense, choking on a strangled moan.

"yea. ol' fel can be a real gentlemute. gonna treat ya ta something special."

and she knows he is absolutely not lying. not one bit. the moan tumbles the rest of the way out of her, unbidden, but she's well past embarrassment at this point. all that remains is anticipation.
