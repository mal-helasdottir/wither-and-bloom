# UFO Town
#snippit #husbando


There was next to nothing to see in the badlands.  They had left Winne behind at a place Felix called Cas Apach; when she asked what that meant he shrugged and pointed to the remains of a sign marking the entrance to the joint.  Most of the letters had fallen from it so that only “Cas” and “Apach” remained.

He said they would take the car from here, it would get them there much faster and navigate the streets of UFO town better than Winne would. And set about unhooking it from its trailer.

He wasn’t wrong about the speed, but she did miss the space she had in the motorhome.  The back of hatchback had its rear seats removed and replaces with various supplies, cobbled together devices, spare parts and weapons, including the overlarge  demon tooth spear.  This meant she was crammed into the front seat next to him, and worse that thing Roswell had found a spot in her lap.   It laid down and seemed to be sleeping, but she would occasionally see its third eye open to look at her as they traveled.  At one point she found herself absently stroking the creatures soft fur but stopped herself when she realized what she was doing.

The drive was very dull.  They were far enough away from Gluttony at this point that the sky was mostly blue with only a slight greenish tinge at its edges. Even Felix had run out of things to point out to her and as the drive carried on she found he could be silent… mostly.  He would still perk up when certain songs would begin to play over the cars speakers and he would sing off key along with them, often prefacing it with “Oh this is a good one!” and turning the volume up enough that the bass would rattle the vehicle and its contents.

After they passed a rusted green sign that had been spray painted over to read UFO town 10 miles. He turned down the radio and pulled to the side of the road.  Ahead she could see the beginnings of the buildings that made up the town.  A collection of old world ruins repurposed and rebuilt with ramshackle supplies.

Felix cut the engine.  He sat silent for several seconds the only sound being the occasional creak and tick of contracting metal bits as the engine cooled.  She was ready to ask him what they were waiting for when he turned to her.

“When we get into to town I’m goin’ ta need ya to do what I tell ya.  This ain’t a Mute town and It certainly ain’t no Corpo town.  The people here are… odd. An I wouldn’t be comin’ here if I didn’t need these bolts I’m owed.”

She wasn’t sure what he meant fully but bristled at the idea of taking more of his orders, and this obsession with ‘bolts’ was working her nerves.  
“I thought we were going some place to get help with finding rose…” She folds her arms across her chest, her lips forming a defiant thin line.

“We are goin ta do that, I told ya we would, but after I get my bolts.  We will need em ta hire trackers a# titlend ta squeeze the info brokers.”

She was unconvinced. "I fail to see how these *bolts* you want will help us.  Surely any *tracker* or *info broker* would want corporate marks of credit for their service, and any true citizen should be honored to help me and my sister when the circumstances are explained.  Rose is the *prodigy* after all."

Felix's' tail twitches uncomfortably with annoyance against the car seat.  "I just told ya this ain't no corpo town.  Creds and scrip ain't hardly worth the paper they is printed on out in the waste.  Also people here are more likely ta think yer crazier than a black blood on a bender if ya start sayin yer lookin' fer the prodigy or are her sister. "

"Then why are we here?  We should be going to a proper franchise or better yet Zion itself!  If you take me there you will be rewarded I'm sure! " 

He grits his sharp teeth and speaks between them, "We been through this already buttercup they would kill me just fer havin' ya no matter what we tell em.  You didn't see how they were in that *garden* of yers they were killin' everyone that weren't already dead I'm not convinced they wouldn't have killed you too."

She narrows her eyes and her lower lip juts out the perfect image of petulance, "I don't agree. If I can explain to them..."

He cuts her off with a frustrated grunt, "I ain't takin' that chance! We need ta find Rose first.  If she really IS the *prodigy* then only her word can save us from yer people, so we are goin ta find her *My way* an my way needs cold hard nuts an bolts, and that,"  He points to rebuilt ruins ahead of them, "is where we get 'em."  He turns in his seat facing his body more towards her his face and voice softening, "An that place is dangerous, the people there ain't mine and they certainly aint yers, but its our best bet ta get what we need to find yer Rose."

She throws her head back purposely looking away from this infuriating creature beside her.  Roswell who had been watching the argument with some interest from her spot in Violet's lap tilts her head in Felix's direction two of her large red eyes remain fixed on him while the third keeps close watch on the underside of Violet's chin.

"Look Vi yer a *eel outta the aquifier* here, I just need ya to do what I tell ya so we can get this done then go about findin' yer sister."

She stares out the window for a long moment before her shoulders relax slightly and she turns back to him.  "Fine. But once this is done we waste no more time. We go strait to these *trackers* of yours, every moment wasted is another my sister is in danger."

He sighs with a measure of relief.  "Deal, but I need ya to promise me you will listen ta me in here."

Her eyes narrow again dangerously she senses a trick but sees no other option with out wasting more time arguing.  She won't blindly follow his orders no matter what she swears or promises, but if it will get them moving towards rose she will placate him.  For now.  So, she crosses the fingers of her left hand hidden beneath her folded arms before saying, "I promise."

Lanky towns have never quite sat right with Felix.  The whole vibe was always just slightly... strange.  UFO town was no different.  As the car pulled off the highway and started to coast between the repurposed buildings there were no organized check points like you might find in a corpo town and no mute sherriff signaling you to pull over so he can introduce himself and tell you the way of things, but rather you were greeted with closed doors and flipped signs.  The slower folk you might catch a glimpse of as they lowered the blinds or silently beckoned in their playing children off the street, but you were more likely to see the mechanical gaze of cameras that followed your progress as you passed. 

The people that lived here could almost pass as run of the mill human, but their limbs were just a little too long or their skin a little to grey.  Their eyes slightly too large and their nose too small.  The effect made their heads seem too large even when they weren't.  The more glimpse you caught of the retreating populous the more obvious it was that these people were only mostly human.  What the other part was Felix didn't quite know.  Mutes were obviously not fully human with their animalistic features; feathers, fur, claws and scales were honest in their anti-humanity. Lanky folk were sometimes uncanny valley writ large. 

"I thought you said this wasn't a mutant town?" Violet asked as her eyes followed the progress of a child with a reverse set of thumbs on their hands being ushered inside by their mother.

"It ain't... they aint mutes."

Felix turned the car down a side street, hoping he could remember how to get to the rendezvous.  The last thing he wanted to do was to get lost in a Lanky town. 

"They don't look like normal humans though... wouldn't that make them mutants?"

He stopped himself from laughing at the thought of anything in the world being *normal* and settled for a toothy grin in her direction.  

"Yeah they ain't human either... My boy Cid says they are called Annuks... or Ankai or somethin' like that. Most of us call 'em the Lanky folk."

She purses her lips and taps a slender finger to them unsure of what to think of this.  They must be mutants if they aren't human.  What else could they be?  She opens her mouth to object then stops as Felix pulls the car over next to a row of squat derelict buildings.  The street ahead ends in a T intersection and the facade on the building there reads "UFO Museum" or it used to.  the e and one of the m's has gone missing so it is now the "UFO Mus u ".

He turns and looks at her with a serious expression.  

"OK this is the place. Put yer cloak on and keep the hood up"

Annoying.  Unnecessary.  But easy enough to do really.  she debates arguing it anyways but decides its best to let him think she is still being a *good girl* and obeying his commands.  

She begins pulling on the cloak and tying it in place as he turns and starts rummaging through the piles of assorted junk in the back seat.   He tosses things aside and ends up having to lean further in to really reach down into floor beneath the rear seats to find whatever it is he is seeking.

"Imagine," she says as she ties the clasps of her cloak off while pulling up and adjusting its hood into place, "organizing things in any sort of way that makes sense."

He mumbles to himself as he continues his hunt and eventually finds what he is looking for and exclaims as such, and in his hurry to return upright with his prize ends up knocking his head against the butt of the overlarge spear that had been haphazardly tossed about in the search.  He holds his price in one hand and rubs the back of his head in the other as he glares at the offending weapon.  Its a small cylindrical object wrapped in a length of cloth, concealing its true identity from her.  

"What's that?" she asks looking at the mystery package.

"Huh?" he says remembering her suddenly.  "Oh its the payload."  He quickly tucks it into an interior pocked of his duster.

"The.. Payload?"  she raises a hooded eyebrow. 

"yeah its what they hired me ta bring em'."  He replies as though that answers her question, and before she raise it again he is examining her and reaches to make a minute adjustment to her hood. She reflexively pulls back and bats at his hand with annoyance. "Good he says. keep that up and I need ya to wait here in the car I wont be long."

Her eyes widen then narrow dangerously; her lips form a thin unamused line and the subtle way her jaw shifts suggest the grinding of teeth beneath them. He braces himself the impact as the tide of her defiance begins to swell and threaten to break over the levies of reason.  He leans back and throws up his hands in a placating gesture. 

"I won't be long and I need ya ta stay here these people are dangerous Vi."

"No." her reply is several octaves lower and many decibels quieter than he was expecting, but the stubborn defiance and finality is there none the less,  "I'll wear your stupid cloak, but I refuse to be left behind while you blunder about and waste time."  She unclicks her seatbelt then folds her arms across her chest staring at him with a resolute finality.

He takes a moment and chokes back his own frustration and exhales a long breath struggling to hold onto calm reason hoping against odds it can win out in the end.  

"Vi..." he stretches out her name as though it might reach her better if he spoke slowly and deliberately.. he locks his mismatched eyes with her own the pleading, borderline desperate appeal writ large on his features, "Vi you promised you'd listen and I mean it when I say its not safe.  I need ya ta stay here." 

His seemingly sincere plea catches her off guard, she too had braced for another fight, but this look of his, so at odds with usual smarmy self, gave her a moments pause, and in that sweetest of moments he thought he had reached her maybe, he had won out and she would listen, but it quickly passed and she turned her head away from him with a huff.

"I promised I'd *listen*, not that I'd follow all your orders. And I *will not* sit around waiting for you to solve all my problems like some helpless maiden."  She tilts her head back imperiously pointing her nose towards the heavens her hood falling back with the motion.  "I can handle my self better than you ever could, so not taking me with you to meet these *dangerous people* is putting an unnecessary risk upon your self *mutant*, not *me*.  And I refuse to let you compromise *my* chances to find Rose."

He makes a frustrated noise through gritted sharp teeth then and thinks how much easier it would have been had he just left her in that god forsaken bunker.

"You don't know what yer talkin' about Vi, these guys ain't like yer normal.."

She moves suddenly and with a quickness neither he nor the lazing Roswell in her lap expected. She lunged forward one knee resting on the console between them and positioned her face inches from his own cutting him off with a hissed "No!" 

Roswell, ejected from her perch suddenly, retreated into the cavern of junk in the backseat of the car.  Three lamplight eyes could be seen reflecting out from it's recesses. 

Violet narrowed her eyes to lock Felix's in place, "If I hear one more time that I don't know what I'm talking about I will show you how dangerous *I* am."  

He reads the challenge in her eyes and he knows this argument is lost to him. With her face so close to his he can smell the sweetness on her breath from the extra honey she added to her morning's oatcakes.  Her cheeks flushed pink with heat and anger and her lips, though drawn in a defiant line were oh so close to his own. He could hear the accelerated rhythm of her pulse as her adrenaline surged.  He'd be lying to himself if he didn't find this all more than a little enticing.  

He wondered briefly how she would react if he kissed her then, would she fall into it like they do in the old John Hughes films of another era? Her clenched fists giving way to fumbling hands and hastily discarded clothing? Probably not.  Unfortunate really.  Oh well.  Time for plan B.

He allowed his customary smirk to draw upon his lips then, and his eyes sparkled as he lean back far enough so that his head bumped against the car's window holding both hands out palms up so she can read his retreating expression.  

"All right buttercup.  You win." he says attempting to inject as much frustrating charm as he is able. "You can come with."  

She doesn't trust it at first, not one bit, but she does lean back into her seat again her posture untensing slightly.   

"But these lanky boys got a way of unsettlin' folk."  He unbuckles his own seatbelt.  "Some people lose time talkin' to em.  Cid says it's somethin' ta do with psychic somethin' er other... mind fuckery."  He waggles a finger in a circle next to his head while crossing his eyes.  

She looks at him with an incredulous expression.  "You won't scare me into not going."

"Scare ya nothin';  preparin' ya.  Try ta keep yer head strait.  Cid told me it helps him ta do math or number magic or somethin' in his head while talkin to em."

"You keep mentioning this Cid like its someone I should know."

"Oh yeah.  Cid's a brother of Gnosis, so 'es real smart.  Shitty at Street Fighter two though.  But he will kick yer ass at pong... which is a boring game anyways." 

She stares at him blankly, "That doesn't really explain... ya know what it doesn't matter. Does doing math in your head work for you?" 

He laughs suddenly but forces himself to stop when her eyes narrow again as she feels he may be mocking her, and he just grins at her instead, "Na girl, I don't do math in my head or anywhere else unless I want a head ache."

"Then how do you fight the... *Mind fuckery?*"

He shrugs, "It just don't work well on me really.  I feel when they do it, things get a little buzzy like I had a nip or two of booze, but nothin' more than that.  Cid says it's either cuz of my mutation or cuz I'm too dumb to be affected by it." He grins pointedly at her and taps the side of his head. "Could be either if I'm bein' honest."

She rolls her eyes and quickly turns away from him hoping he didn't notice the smallest of smiles that had come unbidden across her lips in response to his latest grin.  He clocked it of course, but didn't mention it for her sake.     

"Anything else?" she asked.

"Yeah.  Just be ready. If shit starts ta look rusty follow my lead.  And just ta be safe I'd start doin that math in yer head now."

She nods.  Her earlier defiance and anger replaced with determination.  He can see her focus on him, but the slight furrow in her brow tells him she is following his advice and probably thinking of whatever kind of math they taught her in that bunker she grew up in.  

"Aight," he says, "let me get yer door it sticks."  With out waiting he leaned over her purposely passing close by her, his neck just inches from her so she can smell his scent that reminded her of all the wild things that frequented the fairy tales she was fond of as a child.  

She could feel the heavy muscles of his form press against her for a mere moment.  She hadn't expected the sudden proximity and the surge of electricity that course through her her body at the sudden touch caught her breath for a moment, but then she sensed an opportunity and took it, a deft hand and slender fingers removing something from an inner coat pocket  to squirrel it away under her cloak.  A small victory and internal celebration that is just as quickly shattered and ruined when she hears the sudden clicking sounds and feels the cold steel close against her other wrist.

Her head snaps down to see the cuff and chain securing her right arm to the car door interior hand hold.  She grasps the cuffed wrist with her free hand tests the chain, which holds fast against the car door.  She tugs at it several more times understanding turning to rage as she hears the drivers side door open and feels the shifting as Felix steps out of the vehicle.  She turns too late and tries to grasp at him her claws only finding empty air as her new tether prevents her reaching his retreating leg as he steps out of the car.

She seethes looking at her chained arm then back at him as he leans down to look back in at her from outside the car door.

"Sorry Vi.  It's too dangerous I can't let them know about ya."

She stairs mouth agape  unable to respond right away and then she starts to scream with frustration and rage, and he quickly shuts the car door on her to muffle her outside the vehicle, which shakes as she tugs and pulls at the cuffed arm.

The UFO museum was a boxy unassuming building for the most part, its most distinguishing feature being the faded blue sign labeling it and what remained of the eponymous UFO flying saucer model that had degraded to little more than an odd circular frame.  Like most of the other buildings in downtown UFO town the place looked abandoned.  Several of its windows were boarded over and it was impossible to see past the gloom inside those that weren't.

As Felix approached the buildings front doors he found them to be chained shut. He stood there for a moment and scratched the back of his head.

"Shit" he muttered.

Had he gotten the wrong place. No this is where they said to go.  He glanced back down the road and saw the car had stopped shaking, so Violet must have calmed some, but the last thing we wanted to do was get back in the car and have to tell her he had the wrong address or some shit.  He grabbed the door handles and with a quick rattling shake he found the doors to be locked in addition to very securely chained.

He leaned in then wiped a layer of grime from the glass door and attempted to peer past the gloom inside.  He could make out the vague forms of an empty reception area with ticket counters and gift stands and make out some rotting t-shirts with cartoonish big headed grey men on them, but no signs of movement or anything.

He swore again and decided to knock.  Nothing happened.  He considered taking a chunk of the nearby crumbling asphalt and smashing his way in, but decided that if the lanky's were in there they might consider that an attack.  Maybe he was supposed to go the back door.  They could have told him that. He wasn't lying when he told Violet that talking to them could be disorienting, and even though it didn't seem to affect him as bad as others it did still muddy the sewage. 

He looked back once more towards the car.  The sun was starting to level with and dip below the tops of the buildings and it would be dusk soon.  He wanted to be out of here before dark.

He moved away from the door then intending to follow around the sides of the buildings to its rear when there was a blinding flash of white light from inside.  His eyes squinted to slits and he reflexively threw an arm up against the flash.  He heard the chains on the door unwind themselves and caught a faint whiff of what smelled like burning paper followed by something sickly sweet like a piece of fruit on the edge of rotting. The blinding flash faded slowly and he heard the old doors scrape open then close again before he could properly see. 

Felix blinked several times waiting for the white after image of the sudden flash to fade and he felt their presence before he could clearly see them, the back of his head already starting to buzz and ache.  There were two of them standing before the door, which was chained shut again behind them.  

They were both tall with skin so pale it was almost as white as the light they seemingly emerged from.  They wore crisp black suits cleaned and pressed, completely incongruous with the dirty and broken down environment.  They were nearly identical in appearance; with eyes slightly too big; a nose nearly too small; and their lips were little more than thin lines. To say they were bald was an understatement.  In addition to have no hair on their heads of faces they also had no eyebrows or even eyelashes.  Their limbs, in contrast to their facial features were all just slightly too long.

Only a few things set them apart from one another. One had noticeably bigger ears, which were still too small, while the others ears were so small that they were almost just holes on the side of their head. Their eyes also varied.  One had watery blue eyes that seemed pale against their dark sclera, and others eyes were a darker color over all a rich amber color.  They also each word different black hats.  Blue eyes sported a fedora atop his bald head and the other a bowler style cap.

Fedora spoke first. His voice was deadpan and serious, but there was somethin behind it that almost made it seem as though the air rippled.

"You are the thief. The one called Felix."

Before Felix could respond bowler added in his own buzzing monotone, "I am Mr. Squid and this one is Mr. Athens.  Did you see inside the Garden? Did you go beneath the dirt?"

Mr. Athens nodded, "You are late. You took longer than expected."

Felix blinked again and shook his head in an attempt to clear the sudden wobbly feeling He looked at Athens.  "Yeah, the only thing was rusty from the start.  Everyone in that place was dead... till the corpos showed up that is..." 

Mr. Fish and Mr. Athens both tilted their head simultaneously as they took in his words.  The buzzing in his brain intensified for a moment and Felix choked on his words for a second which caused his words to catch for a moment before he added, "It slowed everything down is all."

Mr. Fish spoke first this time, "Did the death unsettle you? How deep did you dig?"

Mr. Athens followed instantly with, "You retrieved the spine. You completed your part. They weren't all dead."

Mr. Fish, "Why did you say they were all dead? Do lies bring you comfort?"

A bead of sweat rolls into Felix's eye and he wipes it away, taking the opportunity to rube the sides of his temples as well.  Of course they knew about Violet.  Idiot he thinks someone in the town must be reporting to them.  He should have left her in Winnie.  

"The details don't matter.  I got yer spine.  I just want my bolts and you lot will never have ta see my again."

Mr. Athens, "The details matter. We have questions for you both."

Mr. Fish, "Would the bolts set you at ease? Would they help you speak the truth? What else was in the garden?"

Mr. Athens, "The details are important. We will retrieve the spine from your vehicle."

"No, no you don't need ta do that I got it right here."  He pats the interior pocket when he had placed the strange device he was hired to procure for them, and found it flat and empty. "wait.."  He pulls open the coat and sticks his hand in the pocket.  Empty.  He beings desperately checking his other pockets turning them inside out one by one, dropping nothing but lint and empty bullet casings in the process.  "shit its right here."  He cranes his neck rechecking his pockets.. "fuck."

Mr. Fish, "Does the truth frighten you?"

Mr. Athens, "We are retrieving the spine and the other one now.  We are not fools"
