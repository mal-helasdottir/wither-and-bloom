# demonfields

---

## overview

The **Demonfields** are nine concentrated zones within [[05 places/the wastes\|the wastes]] where the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|Fallen Flesh]] has fully taken root. Here, the corruption isn't creeping or subtle—the land itself is meat. The ground pulses. The air tastes of iron and rot. Reality bends to alien hungers.

Each field is ruled by a [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devil Prince]]: a failed child of the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|Prodigy Project]] who consumed a [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|sliver of divinity]] and fleshwarped into something monstrous rather than transcendent. The Devil shapes the field. The field reflects the Devil. Over time, the two become inseparable—the prince's neuroses made manifest across miles of living terrain.

The fields loosely correspond to the circles of Dante's Inferno—whether by cosmic coincidence, the CEO's literary pretensions, or something stranger.

## origin

The Demonfields were born in the moment of the CEO's [[06 concepts/apotheosis\|first apotheosis]].

When he consumed the Fallen Flesh and tried to absorb its power, he surged with uncontrollable [[06 concepts/flesh warping\|flesh warping]]—nearly tearing himself apart. As he fought to hold his form together, fragments of divine Flesh flew from his body and scattered across the continent. These fragments became seeds.

Where they landed, they grew. They consumed. They reproduced. The land beneath them warped into living meat, and from that meat, the first [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] crawled. The corruption spread outward from these seeds, poisoning the surrounding territory.

The [[03 people/the ceo\|CEO]]'s own prophecies refer to these spawn as "rogue Fleshlings"—technically his, born from his moment of weakness, but beyond his direct control. The Third Prophecy states they will "consume and grow and reproduce unchecked" until he achieves true godhood. Until then, his dominion over them remains fickle at best.

## the wyrmwinds

The fields are not passive. They _breathe_.

The concentrated Flesh in the demonfields produces massive atmospheric disturbances called **Wyrmwinds**—storms of unknown composition that roll out across the wastes and beyond. These storms are actively terraforming the world, reshaping the atmosphere into something better suited for what the Flesh considers "perfect evolution."

For those caught in a Wyrmwind without shelter, the results vary from mutation to dissolution to worse things that don't have names.

**Official propaganda** frames the Wyrmwinds as holy cleansing storms sent to purify the sinful wastes. The faithful are instructed to shelter and pray when one approaches—those caught in the storm clearly had sin in their hearts. The truth is simpler and worse: the storms don't discriminate. They're just doing what Flesh does. Growing.

## the fields and the empire

The [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|corporate empire of zion]] views the Demonfields as managed assets rather than territory to reclaim.

**Strategic value**: [[05 places/the gardens\|Gardens]] are deliberately built at the edges of the wastes, near demonfields, for easy access to demons (test subjects), raw Flesh (materials), and a convenient dumping ground for failed experiments. The fields themselves serve as natural barriers—no army is marching through that.

**Propaganda**: The official line frames the fields as land stained by "the Sins of the old world." Only the CEO can call the demons to heel and eventually cleanse the corruption. The masses are taught to fear the wastes and trust the empire's protection.

**Actual control**: The CEO _can_ assert dominance over demons and Devils—they're made from his flesh, after all. But maintaining that control requires active effort he can't spare while also holding himself together. The Third Prophecy promises this will change when he achieves true godhood. Until then, the fields remain semi-autonomous horrors at the edge of his empire.

## the nine fields

### limbo

| **location**       | closest field to [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dante's circle** | the vestibule and citadel—hell's waiting room for fence-sitters and virtuous pagans |
| **prince**         | [[04 groups/the devil princes#baba yaga\|Baba Yaga]]                                          |


**Vibe**: Bureaucratic purgatory. Endless waiting. The cosmic DMV. The demon answer to taking a ticket and waiting to be served... except your number will never be called.

The smallest and strangest of the fields—and one of the resistance's darkest secrets.

[[05 places/battery city\|Battery City]] leadership has struck a bargain with Baba Yaga: safe passage through the field in exchange for a steady supply of new [[04 groups/demons\|demons]]. When mutant soldiers burn out on [[06 concepts/liquid dark\|Liquid Night]]—used too much, too often, past the point of return—they're quietly sent here to turn. Most of the demons in Limbo are former mutants. The "virtuous pagans" of this hell.

Baba Yaga herself is one of the youngest Devils, from a later batch when the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|Prodigy experiments]] were starting to work. She retained more of her humanity than most—enough sanity to negotiate, enough self-interest to honor deals. She can be bargained with. Reasoned with.

It's not safe, but it's _negotiable_ in ways other fields aren't.

---

### lust

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|the carnal sinners, blown about by endless winds|
|**prince**|not named (floated: Cleopatra or other historical figure; possibly "beast with two backs" — two bodies fused)|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Floated idea: the prince is two candidates who ate the sliver together and fused into a single two-bodied creature. "Beast with two backs."

---

### gluttony

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|outside [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#bethlehem\|Bethlehem]] (El Paso)|
|**dante's circle**|the circle of gluttons, lying in freezing slush|
|**prince**|[[04 groups/the devil princes#cerberus\|Cerberus]]|

**Vibe**: Hunger as ecosystem. The stomach of a concept. Eat or be eaten—no, eat AND be eaten. Gluttony isn't about hunger. It's about _never stopping_.

The field most people picture when they imagine a Demonfield—and therefore the most dangerous assumption to make about the others.

Gluttony is simple. Everything here hunts. Everything here feeds. The Devil is a beast (possibly formed from twins or triplets who ate the sliver together, fusing into a three-headed nightmare), and so the field is bestial. It rains blood and worse. The [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] are all claws and teeth and endless appetite. They don't negotiate. They don't scheme. They just _consume_.

Even if Cerberus were somehow "liberated" from the CEO's influence, nothing would change. He'd still try to eat anyone who wandered in. The hunger isn't imposed—it's what he _is_.

This is what outsiders think all fields are like. The others are more subtle—which makes them more dangerous.

> [!info] NARRATIVE NOTE Gluttony is positioned as Felix and Violet's _introduction_ to Demonfields—near Eden, encountered during their escape. Its straightforward brutality makes it ideal for teaching the reader what a demonfield is before later fields subvert those expectations with more complex rules and politics.

---

### greed / avarice

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|hoarders and spendthrifts pushing great weights|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT

---

### wrath / sloth

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|the wrathful fight on the Styx's surface; the slothful gurgle beneath|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Note: Dante combines these in one circle. Do we split them into separate fields or keep them merged?

---

### heresy

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|heretics trapped in flaming tombs|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT

---

### violence

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|Gettysburg? Shiloh? (Civil War battlefield floated)|
|**dante's circle**|three rings—violence against others, self, and God/nature|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT The battlefield location feels right—violence soaked into the land long before the Flesh arrived.

---

### fraud / malebolgia

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|ten ditches (bolge) for different types of fraudsters|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Open question: Is this one large field with distinct zones, or multiple smaller connected fields? Dante's version has ten sub-regions (seducers, flatterers, simonists, sorcerers, grafters, hypocrites, thieves, fraudulent counselors, sowers of discord, falsifiers).

---

### treachery

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|contained within the office and residence of [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]|
|**dante's circle**|the frozen lake at hell's center, Satan trapped in ice|
|**prince**|[[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] himself?|

**Vibe**: The innermost circle. The coldest betrayal. Not a geographic field in the wastes at all—Treachery exists within the heart of Zion itself.

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT If Treachery is inside the CEO's own domain, what does that mean? Is it a literal demonfield contained within his residence? A metaphorical designation? Does he count as its prince, or is there something else trapped at the center of his power?

---

## ecology & hazards

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT
> 
> - What lives in the fields besides demons? Mutated wildlife? Flesh-twisted plants?
> - Environmental hazards beyond Wyrmwinds: radiation pockets, Flesh-tainted water, atmospheric toxins?
> - Are there any resources worth harvesting, or is it purely hostile territory?

---

## navigation & travel

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT
> 
> - How do people cross near the fields? Known safe(r) paths? Guides?
> - Do smugglers and runners have routes that skirt the edges?
> - How close can you get to a field before it's too late?
> - Are the borders sharp or gradual?

---

## open questions

> [!question] TO RESOLVE
> 
> - **Houston**: Floated as a field location. Which circle fits the swamp/flood imagery?
> - **Field borders**: Do fields have clear boundaries, or do they bleed into the surrounding wastes?
> - **Field expansion**: Are individual fields growing? Stable? Can a field be destroyed or contained?
> - **Sloth**: Dante combines Wrath and Sloth in one circle. Do we split them or keep them merged?
> - **The count**: With Treachery inside the CEO's residence rather than in the wastes, do we still have 9 geographic fields? Or is the number different?
