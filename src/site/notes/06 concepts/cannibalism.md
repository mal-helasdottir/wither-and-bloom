# cannibalism

In the world of *Wither & Bloom*, **cannibalism is a scientifically proven method of power transference**. It is not myth or taboo among the fallen — it is a method of war, evolution, and transformation.

---

## ✅ Who Practices It

- [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devils and devil princes]]
- [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and **flesh-warped entities**  
- [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] and his **corpo-aligned agents**  
- [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|prodigy project]] scientists and their test subjects  

These groups treat cannibalism as a **biological fact** and an **arcane inheritance**. It is foundational to their experiments and survival strategies.

---

## ❌ Who Rejects It

- [[04 groups/mutants\|Mütes]]  
  Mütes do not practice cannibalism — not because of moral superiority, but because they believe it’s **conspiracy-tier bullshit**.  

> The idea that eating flesh grants power seems as implausible to them as adrenochrome harvesting does to us.

---

## 🧪 What It Does

- Transfers **power**, **memory**, and **mutation** from one body to another.
- Can be done via:
  - **Ingestion**
  - **Injection**
  - **Tissue integration**
- Cannibalism of divine or mutated flesh may lead to:
  - Increased physical abilities  
  - Mutation or transformation  
  - Absorption of specific traits (e.g. healing, energy manipulation)

## ⚠️ Known Uses

- [[03 people/felix\|felix]] eats [[03 people/violet\|violet]]’s Eye  
  A strategic act to fake her death and deny the corpos access to her gift. The eye may later grant him a lesser version of her energy manipulation.

- [[03 people/rose\|rose]] eats [[03 people/felix\|felix]]’s Arm  
  Occurs after she captures him. She gains a copy of his healing factor — likely permanent.

- [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] consume one another  
  Often. For dominance, stability, evolution, or memory.
