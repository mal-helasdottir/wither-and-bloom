# Polly

A [[04 groups/mutants\|mutant]] sex worker and fence operating out of [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#jericho\|Jericho]].

## Occupation

- **Cover**: Runs a high-class tailor's shop in Jericho's mute district
- **Actual work**: Prostitute who caters (illegally) to corpo clientele; uses the shop for discreet "fittings"
- **Side hustle**: Fence for stolen goods and contraband

## Appearance

- Wears a mask (kinky clients pay extra for her to remove it)
- Often seen in a sheer robe around her living quarters

## Personality & Dynamics

- Professional, composed, in control
- Dominant with clients: "get on your *knees*, little bug"
- Submissive with [[03 people/kal\|Kal]]: "yes, *daddy*"
- "Big sister who wants the best for you" vibes
- Warm, genuine — [[03 people/violet\|Stel]] loves her, finds her reminiscent of [[03 people/rose\|rose]] but warmer

## Key Relationships

### [[03 people/felix\|Felix]]
- Old acquaintance; Felix uses her place as a safe house / crash pad in Jericho
- She's very fond of him but maintains professional boundaries

### [[03 people/kal\|Kal]]

- He loves her
- Eventually they flee together with other mute refugees to [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]] or another frontier town

## Role in the Narrative

- She attempts to use Kal to sneak contraband into evidence
- Plan goes wrong; this triggers their eventual flight from Jericho
- Part of the mute refugee exodus

<!-- NOTES FOR LATER:
- What are her mutant traits? (animal coding not established)
- Floated: she and Felix may have had a thing before Kal came around
- Floated: probably hasn't touched Felix's tail (professional boundaries)
- How did she and Felix meet?
- What's her history before the tailor shop?
