# The Eldest Ones

The three primal gods‚Äî**[[03 people/The Infinite Pattern\|The Infinite Pattern]]**, **[[03 people/The Fallen Flesh\|The Fallen Flesh]]**, and **[[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Diminished One]]** (Roz)‚Äîform the oldest and most powerful forces in the Wither & Bloom cosmology. They are not worshipped equally, nor do they desire it. Their relationships with each other are defined by betrayal, opposition, recursion, and strange alliances.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Metaphysical Triangle

This divine triangle governs the underlying tensions of the world. Each god can subvert or destabilize another‚Äîbut never dominate all.

| God                    | Strong Against     | Reason                                                                                       | Weak To               | Reason                                                                                       |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The Pattern**        | The Flesh           | Its recursion, logic, and systems can encode or contain biological proliferation. Metal and thought disrupt organic cohesion. | The Diminished One     | Chaos breaks recursion. Whimsy introduces variables the Pattern cannot anticipate or control. |
| **The Flesh**          | The Diminished One  | It overwhelms with sheer volume, replication, and physical presence. Chaos is formless; Flesh gives form to everything. | The Pattern             | It cannot outthink logic. Pattern‚Äôs structure limits its unrestrained mutation.              |
| **The Diminished One** | The Pattern         | Chaos destabilizes order. Roz introduces flaws, variance, entropy‚Äîthings the Pattern cannot map. | The Flesh              | The Flesh simply consumes. Roz cannot trick hunger or seduce instinct.                       |

- This triangle reflects **influence**, not brute force.
- Dominance in one domain **always exposes weakness** in another.
- Roz isn‚Äôt physically stronger than the Pattern‚Äîjust more disruptive.
- The Pattern doesn‚Äôt eat the Flesh‚Äîit just **builds a cage around it**.

## üîÅ The Pattern

- **Methods**: Recursion, inevitability, systemic absorption.
- **View of Others**:
  - **Flesh**: A biological error. Growth without limits. Must be contained.
  - **Roz**: Unnecessary noise. A glitch with no productive function.
- **Betrayal**: Tricked Roz into co-forging Star Metal, then dissected her. Still attempting to absorb the rest.
- **Status**: Dormant. Plotting in math. Still the largest existential threat.

---

## ü©∏ The Flesh

- **Methods**: Mutation, growth, consumption, replication.
- **View of Others**:
  - **Pattern**: Inhibitor. Cold and foreign. Its metal and structure are hostile to flesh.
  - **Roz**: Irrelevant. Meat that talks too much.
- **Betrayal**: Exists in opposition to both. Devours what it can, ignores what it can‚Äôt.
- **Status**: Fragmented. Active through avatars. Constantly expanding.

---

## üåÄ The Diminished One / Roz

- **Methods**: Sabotage, mockery, creative entropy, poetic imbalance.
- **View of Others**:
  - **Pattern**: Self-important fool. Loops can always be broken.
  - **Flesh**: Overgrown. Gross. Not fun to play with.
- **Betrayal**: Betrayed first by the Pattern, Roz now refuses structure altogether.
- **Status**: Only partially intact. Actively interfering with both foes for fun.

## üïØÔ∏è Divine Memory

The war between the three is remembered only by:
- The **Brotherhood of Gnosis**
- Certain rogue **Acolytes of the Pattern**
- The **Devils**, born of godflesh and discarded blueprints
- Roz herself (and perhaps a few m√ºtes touched by her favor)

The Empire forgets. The people don‚Äôt know.  
But the gods **never stopped keeping score**.

---

## üíÄ Current Dynamics

- **The Pattern** may awaken to reassert order.
- **The Flesh** spreads via biotech, empire, appetite.
- **Roz** sabotages both‚Äînot to save you, but because it‚Äôs funny.

Each believes the others are **either irrelevant or beneath contempt**.  
All of them are **wrong**.
