#### Anatomy – Genitalia

Felix possesses external genitalia that are largely human in structure, though distinctly altered by his mutant physiology. His body is coyote-coded in both temperament and biology, and this extends subtly but meaningfully to his sexual anatomy. These changes do not impair human compatibility and are, in fact, sources of heightened sensation and function.

##### General Structure

- **Penis shape:**  
  Felix is **uncircumcised**. The foreskin is intact and healthy, retracts easily when aroused, and is highly sensitive. His shaft is thick but not oversized, with a slight upward curve and a more **tapered crown** than a typical human glans. The head is shaped with a more conical rise, a nod to his coyote-leaning traits.

- **Ridges:**  
  Subtle ridges are present just beneath the glans, oriented laterally and only fully perceptible during arousal. These are **not barbs**, but rather **soft, flexible textural structures** that respond to pressure and heat. Their purpose is likely both sensory and evolutionary: they **enhance internal stimulation** for his partner and increase his own sensitivity during sustained contact.

- **Coloration:**  
  His shaft is a **darker slate gray** than the rest of his body, with pigmentation deepening toward the tip. There is a slight gradient effect, though not uniform—marbled variations occur naturally across his skin. The glans is a near-black gray when fully engorged.

- **Knot:**  
  Felix possesses a **canine-style bulbus glandis**, referred to colloquially as a “knot.” It is **not pronounced at rest**, but forms near the base of the shaft during orgasm. When fully engorged, the knot **swells visibly**, creating a temporary seal that can delay or prevent withdrawal. Its purpose appears to be both biological and emotional—**a physical tethering** that aligns narratively with themes of loyalty, bonding, and permanence. The knot is **not obstructive** and does not prevent comfort for his partner when approached with care.

- **Hair/Fur coverage:**  
  The base of his penis and entire scrotal area are covered in **sleek, straight black hair**. It lies flat and smooth, more like **tail fur than pubic hair**, and remains **neatly confined** to the base and surrounding region. This fur extends approximately **one-quarter of the way up the shaft**, tapering gradually. The hair is soft to the touch and low-maintenance, with no tangling or coarseness.

##### Scrotum & Testes

- **Testes shape and position:**  
  Felix’s testicles sit **high and tight** in the scrotum, with an **asymmetrical placement**—one hangs slightly lower, consistent with many real canid species. The scrotum is fully furred in the same black hair, warm to the touch, and rests close to the body. Testicular sensitivity is within human norms, though **slightly higher ejaculatory force and volume** have been observed during climax.

##### Function & Fluids

- **Ejaculate volume and texture:**  
  Felix produces **copious ejaculate**—viscous, slightly thicker than average, but not unnatural in taste or scent. It tends to cling and coat, leaving **a lasting mark** unless cleaned deliberately. This is likely an evolved trait designed to encourage reproductive success in his lineage.

- **Scent:**  
  Though he uses LN to mask it in public, Felix carries a subtle, instinctive **scent signature** in his fluids and skin oils—noticeable only to partners with heightened sensitivity or repeated exposure. Violet picks it up almost immediately and finds it deeply arousing. The scent is musky, earthy, and subtly sweet—**feral but intimate**.

##### Emotional Context

Felix is confident in bed, but quietly self-conscious about his mutant traits—especially the knot and the ridges. He masks this with swagger and jokes, but **deep down he craves being wanted in full**, not in spite of his differences but **because of them**. When Violet touches him with curiosity instead of hesitation, and reverence instead of recoil, it **undoes him more than any orgasm ever could**.

He does not speak of his anatomy with other partners.  
He **trusts Violet** enough to let her see.

## history
### early days
Born in [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#jericho\|Jericho]] to mutant parents. His identifier barcode was 8942F5. His mother (5826N3 *Nikki*) and Father (4374A7 *Alex*) named in *Felix* in the corpo-born Mutant tradition of naming their children after the letter in their given identifier barcode.

Felix's father was in the military and eventually made a gladiator. ==It was determined at his birth the Felix (like most Jericho born mutants)==.  Alex was such a formidable Gladiator he was eventually granted semi-retirement, something rarely done for Gladiators in the [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|Holy Corporate Empire of Zion]]. He would only be occasionally called out for the rare exhibition matches (in hopes that he would finally die).

Felix's mother Nikki was a house servant and cook for a human military officer; Brigadier General Quintus Valens. He was in charge of the HCE's Gladiatorial games.  

### military days
Felix was raised on the military track, so he was only taught skills and abilities suited to becoming a solider.  This did not include much reading or math aside from the most basic of basics.  If Nikki hadn't taken some time to force him to learn at least a few of his words and numbers he would probably be completely illiterate.  

He was an excellent fighter though.  So good that he most likely would have been fast tracked to MOT (Mutant Officer Training) had he not also been horribly insubordinate, obstinate, and stubborn all traits he picked up from dear old dad.

He became quite familiar with the brig and detention from an early age; earning a reputation as a rebel and trouble maker.  Both very bad things in the HCE. He was well liked among fellow mutant soldiers (outside of officers) as he would always go out of his way to help or protect them if he considered them a friend or family.  

Mutants were considered expendable in the Corporate Army and many of his infractions during training were because he would often sacrifice mission objectives in order to keep his fellow soldiers safe, often taking the *wrong* coarse of action that was deemed less efficient or refusing to obey orders to leave behind other mutants during exercises when they were *hurt*. 

Training would sometimes actually hurt a soldier but often they would be considered hit or injured for whatever reason and Army policy was to always leave injured mutants behind especially if mission objectives could be reached in doing so.  Felix often refused to do this opting to find ways to save fellow soldiers at the expense of the mission.  Even if a mission goal was still accomplished he would find himself in trouble anyways for not obeying orders or *delaying* the objective.   

He would also sometimes purposely ignore a *downed* human soldier (this is something he probably wouldn't actually do in the field but he did in training as a bit of a fuck you to his officers) which was also a big source of friction between himself and his human trainers.

At 16 he was transferred to active duty.  The *problems* he exhibited in training carried over into active duty, and he was often scapegoated for failed missions because he tried to save the lives of fallen mutants, whether or not the mission was scuffed from the get go.  He was transferred around a bunch and by the time he was 18 the military was considering having him imprisoned or shot. (Dishonorable Discharge was rarely an option for Mutants.)  Because he was such a talented fighter, however, BG Valens intervened and decided to make him a gladiator. (He is probably unaware that Felix is related to his servant Nikki and his current best gladiator Alex as mutant affairs and what they do in their off-time is very much beneath him, he will find out later though. )  
### gladiator days
Felix took to being a gladiator pretty well.  He enjoyed fighting and was good at it.  Killing in gladiatorial combat is not required, but it isn't discouraged either.  Felix, however tried to only kill when he had no other choice (or occasionally if he found himself in a fight against someone he knew to be an awful person)
