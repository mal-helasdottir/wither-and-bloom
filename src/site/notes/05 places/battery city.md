## history
---

## geography
---
- a sprawling irradiated cave system that seems to expand exponentially as time passes (acid pollution in the water cycle has accelerated the processes by which caves are made)
	- includes the mammoth caves system in kentucky, ozark caverns (missouri), carlsbad caverns in new mexico, caves in texas, tennessee, the dakotas, mexico (because what even are borders at this point?), etc.
	- includes several sufficiently deep and braced commerical mines that have been connected, either naturally or artificially
- contains several giant reasonably pure aquifers and underground river systems, water having left its acids in the stone on the way down (making the caves bigger)(think the fremen of arrakis)
- deep, stable areas feature many many many mushrooms and lichens of all colors, shapes, and sizes. they often glow. most are edible. some have hallucinogenic properties.
