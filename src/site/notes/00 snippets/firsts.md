**battery city, feast of the all-martyr's**
*violet* --
there's something about [[03 people/felix\|him]], [[03 people/violet\|she]] thinks, for what must be the twentieth time just today.

something special.

something... she's staring, and he notices. locks eyes with her across the small crowd and the powdery rainbow clouds. he's covered in the colorful particles, they cling to him with a ghostly reverence, as if he's one of the martyred ancestors this entire celebration is for. the idea of fel being martyred hurts somehow, brings a burn to her eyes and pulls the corners of her mouth down.

always the contrarian, fel grins, widening slowly, growing brighter, like daybreak over the wastes. his fangs glitter in battery city's perpetual twilight, and his eyes are dark and deep, fixed on her.

always on her. she can't look away.

he strides over, still grinning in that sly, smug way of his, but she swears she can hear a too-fast pulse beneath the pink spattered cloth of his shirt, beneath the cage of his ribs. though perhaps she's simply hearing her own pulse. it's difficult to say. it's hard to focus. she can smell him too, snowfall and sweat and the LN he coats all his equipment with.

"vi," he says.

"fel," she replies.

"ya need somethin'?" impossibly, his expression becomes smarmier and her stomach does a flopping dance of betrayal. "ya awful clean... i can help with that."

before she can ask what he means, he lobs a hidden handful of bright blue dust in her face and *runs*.

*felix* --
she's following him.

he stifles a chuckle. a tail is normally a bad thing, but rather than the usual racing thoughts and pulse, the need to escape, there's a bubbling warmth in his chest and a smile tugging at his lips.

he doesn't bother evading her amongst the crowded festival stalls. instead he chooses to consider the merits of the various foods on offer. does he want a mushroom kebab or a fried meat-o platter with noodles? he lingers at a booth where hard candies glitter at him beneath their smokey ln wrappers. 

what would she like? something savory? protein? how hungry is she? is she hungry? maybe she'd just like a sweet.

she is fond of sweets. he recalls the sparkling eyes and greedy fingers the one time they uncovered a little sweetener in alien town, and he made them each a soft, fried bun sprinkled with the stuff. she'd stolen half of his. he didn't hold it against her.

he settles on a handful of the gem colored candy and a kebab, knowing her occasional reluctance to eat meat and resolving to eat it himself before getting her something else if she desires.

the warmth again. likely hungry. or heartburn.

she's still moving through the edges, a dark needle slipping between the thick weft of mutants at play. her hood is down and her long braid is coated with blue powder, as though she wiped the color off her face with it.

he finds a spot beneath the broad gills of a softly luminescing lilac bonnet and sits to wait
