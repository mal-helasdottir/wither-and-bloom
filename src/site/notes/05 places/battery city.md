# [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]
*home of the mutant resistance*

## history
---
- at the time of [[02 history/the revelation\|the revelation]] many groups were unable to secure protection within [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|corpo controlled cities]].
	- poor, homeless, jobless, disabled, etc.
	- poc, lgbtqia+, etc.
	- those with uncertain citizenship status like immigrants, refugees, etc.
- the survivors of these various groups have gone on to found various towns, economies, and criminal networks out in the wastes
	- see: [[05 places/Frontier and Mute Towns\|Frontier and Mute Towns]]

- battery city was founded by a group of aforementioned undesirables who sought shelter from the bombs in cave systems. rampant pollution and toxic fallout accelerated cave expansion, linking systems together and allowing cultural exchange, mutual protection, and networking
- [[04 groups/mutants\|mutation]] sets in over the generations
- aquifers and mushroom groves discovered, allowing mutants to never set foot on the surface if they so desire
- after [[02 history/the restoration\|the restoration]], [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|zion]] begins attempts to systematically exterminate those with mutations who live outside the empire's authority
- nuclear waste stockpile discovered along with mutant's relative immunity to the pile's radiation
- depleted uranium weapons and munitions begin manufacture, seeing regular use against both [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|corpos]]
- currently battery city's hydra-like ability to strike, hide, reroute, and redistribute has resulted in a three way stalemate and a time of relative peace
## geography
---
- a sprawling irradiated cave system that seems to expand exponentially as time passes (acid pollution in the water cycle has accelerated the processes by which caves are made)
	- includes the mammoth caves system in kentucky, ozark caverns (missouri), carlsbad caverns in new mexico, caves in texas, tennessee, the dakotas, mexico (because what even are borders at this point?), etc.
	- includes several sufficiently deep and braced commercial mines that have been connected, either naturally or artificially
- contains several giant reasonably pure aquifers and underground river systems, water having left its acids in the stone on the way down (making the caves bigger)(think the fremen of arrakis)
- deep, stable areas feature many many many mushrooms and lichens of all colors, shapes, and sizes. they often glow. most are edible. some have hallucinogenic properties.
## demographics
---
polyethnic, descended from a smorgasbord of poor, immigrant, disabled, *untermensch*
- mexico
- south america
- south east asia [^1]
- india and surrounds (south asia)
- africans
- indigenous americans, first nations, metis, sami, etc.

skin color, ethnic background, and so on matter little to most modern mutants because most old world ties are lost to time. for example it doesn't matter that bob has copper colored skin, straight black hair, and dark eyes because he *also* has gills, webbed fingers and toes, and patches of skin with scales like a fish (where it isnt copper).
