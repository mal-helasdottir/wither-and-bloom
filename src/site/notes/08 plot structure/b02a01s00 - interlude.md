# 🧩 Narrative Scaffold: Between Battery City & Terror Billy  
*Post-strike. Pre-rescue. Violet rises. Felix suffers. Roz waits.*

---

- 🛻 **1. Winne remains untouched.**

  - After the Corpo strike, resistance fighters locate Winne.
  - It’s miraculously intact — a soft bubble in the blast zone.
  - [[03 people/violet\|violet]] is inside: unconscious, soaked in blood, missing an eye.
  - [[03 people/the diminished one\|roz]] is perched beside her. Silent. Waiting.
  - [[03 people/felix\|felix]]’s mother has Winne towed to a safe zone.  
    The resistance performs a "systems check" — actually a search.
  - Nothing is removed. Winne is left untouched.  
  - Violet wakes up. Refuses to leave Winne. Ever.

---

- 🧿 **2. The eye takes time.**

  - A cloned replacement eye is grown from Eden archives.
  - For several weeks, it remains normal: purple iris, white sclera.
  - Violet moves freely. It helps her blend in, pass for non-müte.
  - But after it’s installed, it begins to darken.
  - First the iris, then the whites — returning, slowly, to black.
  - By then, it’s too late.  
    The [[06 concepts/wither and bloom\|witch mark]] has reclaimed its place.

---

- 📁 **3. Violet returns to Eden.**

  - The resistance reclaims parts of Eden.
  - Violet goes in personally — first with a team, then alone.
  - She combs through:
    - Failed [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|prodigy]] reports  
    - [[06 concepts/apotheosis\|apotheosis]] logs  
    - Clone records  
    - Video archives of [[03 people/rose\|rose]]
  - She finds footage of herself cradling a severed head with white hair.  
    No one tells her what she already knows.  
    She doesn’t speak of it. She simply watches it again.

---

- 🐈 **4. Roz stays close.**

  - Roz never leaves her.
  - They don’t speak. They don’t meow.
  - They watch her [[06 concepts/wither and bloom\|wither]] a spider into dust with a sigh.
  - They nap beside her spine, not on it — just alongside.
  - When Eden maps are spread across the floor, Roz selects them with paws.

---

- 🔥 **5. The rescue plan begins.**

  - Violet tells them Felix is alive.
  - The resistance is skeptical — but she’s right.
  - She starts pulling together stolen data, troop paths, corpo shipping routes.
  - She marks potential black sites.  
    Roz scratches an X on one. It's accurate.
  - She becomes a leader by accident — not by charisma, but by **certainty**.

---

- 📡 **6. Terror Billy (broadcast scene).**

  - One night, comms flicker — a corpo override.
  - A slick, hostile broadcast begins.
  - A blonde corporate sibling reads off Felix’s charges:  
    - Abduction of Violet  
    - Genetic contamination  
    - Stock instability
  - Felix is on-screen: stripped, bruised, grinning.
  - He speaks in müte cant — to Violet.
  - “Don’t come. But if you do — win.”
  - He fights back before the feed cuts out.
  - Pandemonium. Screams.  
    *“She’ll come, we'll fuck on the greasy ashes!”*
  - Then: silence.
  - Violet stands. Walks out.  
    Says only: *“We go south.”*

- 💣 **7. The plan hardens.**

  - Now there’s proof of life.
  - Now there’s location data — triangulated from the broadcast.
  - The resistance coalesces.  
    Not to follow Violet — but to follow the *mission*.
  - This is no longer a favor.  
    It’s a declaration.

---

- 🧭 **8. Next stop: hell.**

  - The facility will be burned.
  - The prisoners will be freed.
  - Violet will see Felix again — or die trying.
