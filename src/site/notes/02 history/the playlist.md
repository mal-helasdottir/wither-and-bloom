---
## apocalypse now
- *we are fucking fucked*, muse

## it's revolution, baby!

## the gods 
### the flesh
- *body*, mother mother
	- the way the flesh is offered up and consumed by lesser beings after her power, the ceo's mirroring of these actions as he creates minions, he cannibalistic nature of demons and devils and a little tongue and cheek reference to catholic eucharist. t
### the pattern
- *starman*, david bowie
	- extremely innocent take on the infinite pattern, making her seem gentle, interested, positive, etc. she's not any of those things but let the children boogie, as they say. t
### the diminished
- *aspiring fires*, mother mother
	- fire - chaotic, ravenous, uncontrollable, viral, nonsensical. *you wanna see me crazy? well i'll show you it's like and then i'll wave goodbye as you run for your life*. *a little advice for aspiring fires: you get put out if you don't get a little wild*. *because crazy in the box is everything that crazy's not*. t
- *string break song*, charming disaster
	- there is no living without destruction. nothing lasts forever. every day takes you one more closer to the last. *chaos is gonna win in the end, the universe is flying apart, there ain't nothing much you can do about it. burn up the candle or live in the dark*? t

## the ceo
## violet
- *anything like me*, poppy
	- *i feel her heart beating in me. get her out of me.* the experience of having rose for a sister and then absorbing part of her. *i'm everything she never was now everyone's out for my blood. stop you're making a scene. you're coming at me with blood in your teeth*. t

## felix
- *i wanna be yours*, arctic monkeys
	- bro wants to be her electric meter and her ford cortina because he won't ever rust. particularly cute because *secrets i have held in my heart* the prevalence of [[06 concepts/the forging of metals\|rust]] in this universe makes him never doing as such particularly valuable. t
