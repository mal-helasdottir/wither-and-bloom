# demonfields

---

## overview

The **Demonfields** are nine concentrated zones within the [[05 places/the demonwastes\|Demonwastes]] where the [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|Fallen Flesh]] has fully taken root. Here, the corruption isn't creeping or subtle—the land itself is meat. The ground pulses. The air tastes of iron and rot. Reality bends to alien hungers.

Each field is ruled by a [[04 groups/the devil princes\|Devil Prince]]: a failed child of the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|Prodigy Project]] who consumed a [[06 concepts/sliver of divinity\|sliver of divinity]] and fleshwarped into something monstrous rather than transcendent. The Devil shapes the field. The field reflects the Devil. Over time, the two become inseparable—the prince's neuroses made manifest across miles of living terrain.

The fields loosely correspond to the circles of Dante's Inferno—whether by cosmic coincidence, the CEO's literary pretensions, or something stranger.

## the nine fields

---

### limbo

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|closest field to [[05 places/battery city\|battery city]]|
|**dante's circle**|the vestibule and citadel—hell's waiting room for fence-sitters and virtuous pagans|
|**prince**|[[04 groups/the devil princes#baba yaga\|Baba Yaga]]|

**Vibe**: Bureaucratic purgatory. Endless waiting. The cosmic DMV. The demon answer to taking a ticket and waiting to be served... except your number will never be called.

The smallest and strangest of the fields—and one of the resistance's darkest secrets.

[[05 places/battery city\|Battery City]] leadership has struck a bargain with Baba Yaga: safe passage through the field in exchange for a steady supply of new [[04 groups/demons\|demons]]. When mutant soldiers burn out on [[06 concepts/liquid dark\|Liquid Night]]—used too much, too often, past the point of return—they're quietly sent here to turn. Most of the demons in Limbo are former mutants. The "virtuous pagans" of this hell.

Baba Yaga herself is one of the youngest Devils, from a later batch when the [[06 concepts/the prodigy project\|Prodigy experiments]] were starting to work. She retained more of her humanity than most—enough sanity to negotiate, enough self-interest to honor deals. She can be bargained with. Reasoned with.

It's not safe, but it's _negotiable_ in ways other fields aren't.

### lust

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|the carnal sinners, blown about by endless winds|
|**prince**|not named (floated: Cleopatra or other historical figure; possibly "beast with two backs" — two bodies fused)|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Floated idea: the prince is two candidates who ate the sliver together and fused into a single two-bodied creature. "Beast with two backs."

---

### gluttony

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|outside [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#bethlehem\|Bethlehem]] (El Paso)|
|**dante's circle**|the circle of gluttons, lying in freezing slush|
|**prince**|[[04 groups/the devil princes#cerberus\|Cerberus]]|

**Vibe**: Hunger as ecosystem. The stomach of a concept. Eat or be eaten—no, eat AND be eaten. Gluttony isn't about hunger. It's about _never stopping_.

The field most people picture when they imagine a Demonfield—and therefore the most dangerous assumption to make about the others.

Gluttony is simple. Everything here hunts. Everything here feeds. The Devil is a beast (possibly formed from twins or triplets who ate the sliver together, fusing into a three-headed nightmare), and so the field is bestial. It rains blood and worse. The [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] are all claws and teeth and endless appetite. They don't negotiate. They don't scheme. They just _consume_.

Even if Cerberus were somehow "liberated" from the CEO's influence, nothing would change. He'd still try to eat anyone who wandered in. The hunger isn't imposed—it's what he _is_.

This is what outsiders think all fields are like. The others are more subtle—which makes them more dangerous.

> [!info] NARRATIVE NOTE Gluttony is positioned as Felix and Violet's _introduction_ to Demonfields—near Eden, encountered during their escape. Its straightforward brutality makes it ideal for teaching the reader what a demonfield is before later fields subvert those expectations with more complex rules and politics.

### greed / avarice

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|hoarders and spendthrifts pushing great weights|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT

---

### wrath / sloth

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|the wrathful fight on the Styx's surface; the slothful gurgle beneath|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Note: Dante combines these in one circle. Do we split them into separate fields or keep them merged?

---

### heresy

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|heretics trapped in flaming tombs|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT

---

### violence

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|Gettysburg? Shiloh? (Civil War battlefield floated)|
|**dante's circle**|three rings—violence against others, self, and God/nature|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT The battlefield location feels right—violence soaked into the land long before the Flesh arrived.

---

### fraud / malebolgia

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|TBD|
|**dante's circle**|ten ditches (bolge) for different types of fraudsters|
|**prince**|not named|

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT Open question: Is this one large field with distinct zones, or multiple smaller connected fields? Dante's version has ten sub-regions (seducers, flatterers, simonists, sorcerers, grafters, hypocrites, thieves, fraudulent counselors, sowers of discord, falsifiers).

---

### treachery

|||
|---|---|
|**location**|contained within the office and residence of [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]|
|**dante's circle**|the frozen lake at hell's center, Satan trapped in ice|
|**prince**|[[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] himself?|

**Vibe**: The innermost circle. The coldest betrayal. Not a geographic field in the wastes at all—Treachery exists within the heart of Zion itself.

> [!question] NEEDS DEVELOPMENT If Treachery is inside the CEO's own domain, what does that mean? Is it a literal demonfield contained within his residence? A metaphorical designation? Does he count as its prince, or is there something else trapped at the center of his power?

---

## open questions

> [!question] TO RESOLVE
> 
> - **Houston**: Floated as a field location. Which circle fits the swamp/flood imagery?
> - **Field borders**: Do fields have clear boundaries, or do they bleed into each other and the broader wastes?
> - **Field expansion**: Are individual fields growing? Stable? Can a field be destroyed or contained?
> - **Sloth**: Dante combines Wrath and Sloth in one circle. Do we split them or keep them merged?
> - **The count**: With Treachery inside the CEO's residence rather than in the wastes, do we still have 9 geographic fields? Or is the number different?
