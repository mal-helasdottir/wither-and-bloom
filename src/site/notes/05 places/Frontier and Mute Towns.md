# Frontier and [[04 groups/mutants\|Mute]] Towns

## Battery City
[[04 groups/mutants\|mutant]] ”Capital“. Home of the Anti-Zion Resistance, AKA Babylon to the [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|Corpos]]
## UFO Town
Formerly Roswell New Mexico, Center of town is remains of the International UFO and Research Museum, which is the seat of government (Mayor and Sheriff most like).  Under the Museum is a secret facility run by the Men in Black and the [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|acolytes of the infinite pattern]].  The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] and MiBs are the true leaders of the town and most who end up in government are either converts or controlled.  

## Lucky 7 (working title open to suggestion)
Possibly once Reno?  A town of vice on the frontier. An old Casino makes up the bulk of the town with a few smaller outposts and buildings around it.  Gamble away your [[06 concepts/currency and trade\|bolts]] or spend the night with a variety of Mute prostitutes.  Caters to [[04 groups/mutants\|mutes]], scavs, smugglers, wasters, raiders, and even [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|corpos]] (though corpos would never reveal or admit to coming here) Leadership is mobster/organized crime type, possibly humans who pay off the corpo military to stay away.  

## 51
What used to be the “secret” military base Area 51.  51 is the primary [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|acolytes of the pattern]] hub.  As such the entire “city” is underground and it’s really more of a base of operations.  Most steer clear of the odd [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Lanky Boys]] and their base, and some pretend its not there even though most smugglers and waste runners know its there because of the stories of people that go missing around there and of the [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Lanky boys]] that are sometimes seen coming and going from that direction.  Most smart waste runners and scavs steer clear.  

## The Monastery (working title, could be The Grand Library or something similar as well)
Home of the enigmatic [[04 groups/the brotherhood of gnosis\|Brotherhood of Gnosis]].  Typically only brothers and sisters of the order are allowed to tread these sacred halls.  This should be the remains of a large library or university. TBD as to which
