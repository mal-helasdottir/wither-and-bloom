# the revelation
the corporate name for the nuclear strikes that ended the old world and allowed [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]] to emerge as the new messiah
the [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|the corporate fellowship]] believes all these events are
1. biblically foretold
2. miraculous
3. meant for the tribulation (and later redemption of mankind)

the book of revelation's title in greek is ἀποκάλυψις (apokalypsis), which can mean *revelation* or *unveiling* and is the root word for *apocalypse*

## the world before
- By the late 21st century, climate change had already reshaped the map. Rising sea levels swallowed coastlines worldwide. The eastern seaboard of the former United States existed in a state of managed crisis—seawalls, pump systems, and constant maintenance holding back the Atlantic from cities that should have drowned decades prior.
- Global infrastructure strained under the weight of climate refugees, resource wars, and the slow-motion collapse of coastal economies.
- The discovery of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] in the Gulf of Mexico and the subsequent development of LN technology offered a temporary reprieve—a new energy source that seemed infinite and renewable. The corporation that would become [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|the corporate fellowship]] rose to prominence on the back of this discovery.
- Humanity had become dependent on LN technology. Power grids, transportation, medicine, manufacturing—all of it ran on derivatives of the Flesh.

## the nuclear strikes
- The Anunnaki's contingency plan was not surgical. It was extinction-level.
    - Orbital nuclear strikes targeted every major population center on the planet. New York. Los Angeles. Tokyo. London. Beijing. Mumbai. São Paulo. Cairo. Every city of significance was marked for death.
    - The strikes on the Gulf of Mexico were meant to destroy [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]'s remains. They failed.
    - The strikes on Austin were meant to kill [[03 people/the ceo\|the CEO]]. The meat dome closed first.
- The eastern seaboard, already drowning before the bombs fell, ceased to exist as habitable land.
    - Nuclear strikes shattered what infrastructure remained.
    - Without constant maintenance, the seawalls failed. The Atlantic rushed in.
    - What the bombs didn't kill, the water claimed. What the water didn't claim, the radiation poisoned.
    - Within a decade, everything east of the Appalachians was either underwater, irradiated beyond survival, or both.
- The global death toll was incalculable. Billions died in the initial strikes. Billions more in the aftermath—starvation, radiation sickness, the collapse of supply chains, the wars that followed.
- The western United States survived in patches. Inland. Higher elevation. Far enough from primary targets to avoid immediate vaporization, close enough to catch the fallout.
    - This is where [[05 places/demonfields\|demonfields]] spread—the Flesh flung from the CEO's body during his failed apotheosis found purchase in irradiated soil.
    - This is where the survivors crawled out of the rubble.
    - This is where the empire would rise.

## The Slow Terraforming

- The green skies are not confined to the demonfields. The whole world is changing.
- LN is the Flesh. Every engine burning LN fuel, every power plant, every product derived from the Flesh—all of it pumps byproducts into the atmosphere. The gas is similar to chlorine. It oxidizes metal. It turns the sky green.
- Humanity has been burning the Flesh for fuel since before the Revelation. Four hundred years later, the atmosphere itself has shifted.
- The demonfields are where the terraforming happens fast and raw—the Flesh unprocessed, uncontrolled, reshaping the land to suit itself. Everywhere else, it happens slow. But it's happening everywhere.
- Metal rusts. The sky is green. The air burns if you're not adapted to it. The world is becoming something else, and every corpo city accelerates the process just by existing.

## Why The Empire Is Western

- The CEO's meat dome protected Austin and its immediate surroundings. When the dome opened after four centuries, Zion emerged into a world where it was one of the only sources of functioning infrastructure, LN technology, and organized society.
- The Demonfields, deadly as they are, exist in the American southwest and west. The Gardens require proximity to Demonfields. The franchises require proximity to Gardens. The empire spread outward from Zion along the paths the Flesh had already carved.
- There was nothing to reclaim in the east. No cities to rebuild. No population to subjugate. No infrastructure to commandeer. Just water, rubble, and rads.
- The empire is western because the west is all that's left.
