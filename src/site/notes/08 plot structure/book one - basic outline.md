# wither & bloom — book one outline

## 1. The Heist at Eden
- Felix of Jericho is contracted by the Acolytes of the Pattern to infiltrate a corpo research facility called **Eden**.
- His mission: steal a new, ultra-pure biospine filled with **Liquid Dark**.
- Roz, Felix’s longtime companion — a bound, diminished godlike being — accompanies him.
- Unknown to Felix, **Rose** has just attempted **apotheosis**, failed, and gone berserk. The facility is in ruins.
- Felix finds **Violet** catatonic, cradling a **severed head** with long white hair and red eyes.
- Unaware of the head’s identity, Felix assumes Violet is another experimental subject. She has a spine grafted to her — not unlike the one he came to steal.
- With corpo forces closing in, he takes her too.

## 2. Recovery and Silence
- Violet remains nearly mute and disoriented.
- Roz does not speak but remains close to both.
- Felix keeps them moving — through badlands, salt zones, and old waste corridors.
- Over time, Violet shows signs of awareness. She knows her name. She doesn’t ask where they’re going.
- Felix doesn't press for answers. He assumes she's too traumatized to talk.

## 3. UFO Town (Midpoint Arc)
- Felix and Violet visit a remote müte salvage town.
- They’re tracked and attacked by multiple enemies — agents from competing factions.
- Violet fights. She’s precise, lethal, silent.
- Felix is badly injured. Violet saves him.
- They flee together, more a team than before.

## 4. Battery City Arrival
- The pair arrive at **Battery City**, an underground müte settlement and trade hub.
- Felix and Roz are familiar faces here.
- They settle into a temporary rhythm: smuggling, barter, quiet.
- Battery City prepares for a **festival**. Violet is treated with awe — or fear.
- She and Felix begin to open up to each other.
- **“Firsts”** occurs here: their first kiss, first shared bed, Violet’s first orgasm, and a deepening emotional bond.

## 5. The Assault on Battery City
- During the festival, the city is struck by massive **corpo ordinance**.
- A portion of the underground structure is **obliterated**, breaching to the surface.
- Felix and Violet are in **Winne**, just outside the direct blast.
- Violet wakes in terror as **Rose's voice** begins to broadcast.
- The sound **breaks her**. She collapses, mind splintering.
- Rose’s voice is Violet’s voice — but wrong. Like something dead trying to speak.
- She demands the city **deliver her sister**, or suffer continued destruction.

## 6. The Truth of the Eye
- Felix now knows: the head in Eden was Rose. Violet killed her.
- He also knows: Rose is back. And she wants Violet.
- Violet is nonresponsive. Utterly broken.
- Felix **removes Violet’s black eye** — the witch mark of wither and bloom — to fake her death.
- He hides her in Winne and leaves to confront Rose.

## 7. Confrontation and Capture
- Felix faces Rose and **claims to have killed and eaten Violet**.
- As proof, he **eats the eye** in front of her.
- They fight. Rose is stronger.
- She discovers Felix has a **healing factor** and realizes he’s biologically valuable.
- Felix **loses his arm** (tentative) and is **captured**.
- Rose and her forces retreat with Felix in custody.
