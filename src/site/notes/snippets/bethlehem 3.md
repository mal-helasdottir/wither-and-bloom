# Bethlehem 3 >> Felix muddling about trying to find the subject in a dark, dead, experimental complex
#snippet #waifu

The silence has weight.

The scruffy toe of his boot crushes something, fragments scattering over the crete with a soft sound.

He freezes, shifts his patch from one eye to the other, cursing himself for not doing it the moment everything went dark. 

A dim yellow glow spreads to show the remnants of something? 

It’s everywhere.

Walls. Floor. Piles of the stuff. Drifts of it. Dunes. Dancing in the air as motes before his illuminated eye.

Using a finger felix sniffs some of the grey powder and finding it not immediately alarming, touches it to his tongue.

Ash. 

"The fuck," he says.

"*Rrrr*," rumbles his coat pocket, though if in agreement or dissent is unclear.

The further he goes the fatter the lines upon the wall and floor, until it’s wide as his two clenched fists, yet it goes on down the corridor. And infinite web linking together to rush forward.

It reminds him uncomfortably of veins.

He ties a spare rag over his nose and mouth, just in case.

His caution is rewarded when far up the wall, where it meets the ceiling, there’s a muted *pop* and more ash cascades all over him.

But not before he saw what it was.

A grey flower, perfect as a fractal and frozen at the height of its beauty, clinging to a climbing vine that leads along the hall.

A grey flower with a closed eye in the soft embrace of its petals.
