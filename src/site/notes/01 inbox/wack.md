# wack ideas that make no sense currently but whatever
*i'm not even sorry*

## his

- Cid at some point maybe leaves the brotherhood after learning some terrible secret, perhaps even before the story begins, he lives with Opal as you suggest but his connection to the brotherhood is strained maybe he is told by opal to like put Felix and Vi in contact with them for Star Metal and he doesn't want to, but does it anyways because Opal says its got to happen that way and he trust her.
- Felix is hired by the crimeboss of the Mutant Ghetto in one of the corpo towns prior to story start to deliver a shipment of LN (the performance enhancer) to the Mutant Rebellion.  Before he makes the delivery though he is camping outside of Battery City not too too far from Limbo.  He is awakened by Roswell and made aware of a torch lit procession of Rebel soldiers.  They are heading toward's liblo with several men in chains.  He follows from a distance and watches as the commander is met by Baba Yaga the Devil of Limbo.  She takes the the chained men whom he comes to realize are soldiers that over did it with LN and have become addicted or are close to demonhood.  These solider/prisoners are then converted into demons by Baba Yaga or maybe some are eaten or whatever and the rebels are allowed to just leave.  He has a crisis of conscious and decides to stash the LN he is smuggling not wanting to give it to the rebellion any more nor return it to the crime boss.  he claims he was attacked by Corpos knowing he will have to repay the shipment plus interest to the crime lord, so he is in trouble for trying to save rebels from the fate he witnessed and he plans to eventually confront the rebellion about it or at least learn what is really going on. 
## hers

- felix's heart resides outside of his body, within violet
- violet, being more flesh than chaos, is the one able to stretch and manipulate her body proportions (think unit 02 beast mode or bloodhound knights) once her suit is jailbroken
	- felix can only do it when dangerously overloaded on ln, because he is more chaos than flesh. his usual mode is becoming a big shadow wolfie (a la [e10](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Eden%27s_Promise:_Litany), the shadowkeeper)
- opal lives outside battery city, cid lives with her as an emissary of the brotherhood and as her personal recorder on behalf of the brotherhood. 
	- opal may be a distant relation of felix? (explaining how cid and felix know each other) 
		- or we stick with felix having done a job for cid and thats how they know each other.
- a person who is (equally? in any ratio? dunno) chaos, flesh, and pattern is this universe's *kwisatz haderach*. i dont think its violet or felix
		-*his* : I think the annunaki who founded the brotherhood is trying to create this creature.  I think what they end up doing is they take Violet's DNA (egg) Felix's DNA (spooge? dont have to be this technical) and combine it with their own pureblood Annunaki DNA to make this kwisatz haderach.  I had this idea floating around previously.  They make this new god or the seed of it.  I think series two that focuses on Cid and Opal would deal with the creature.  This thing is grown to be a new god.  one to counter the other three and establish true balance, and I think in book one this creature works along side Cid and Opal to prevent the Pattern from entering eath's solar system through the hexagon on Saturn.  But at the end we have a twist. This creature realizes what it is and uses it's newfound godhood to unravel the patter as it enters the solar system.  And then book 2 and 3 of series 2 are Cid and Opal trying to stop this creature from like taking everyone and everything over cuz like the first thing it does after unraveling the pattern is subverting the Annunaki and you realize this thing is just as bad or worse than the other 3.
