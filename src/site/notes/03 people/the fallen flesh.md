# The Fallen Flesh

The Flesh — also called the Flesh Warper or the Fallen Flesh — is one of the Three Eldest gods, a primordial force of growth, consumption, and unstoppable adaptation. Unlike [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the Pattern]] or Chaos, it has no interest in meaning or recursion. It simply **devours, spreads, and becomes**.

## 🧠 Identity & Core Nature

- Originally known as **the Flesh Warper**, the god of pure biological expansion and transformation.
- **Defeated** in the great war of the gods and subsequently reduced to a dormant, scattered state. Now referred to as the **Fallen Flesh**.
- Despite its “death,” it remains **semi-sentient and active** through the remnants of its body, particularly:
  - A piece of its **skull or core mass**, buried deep in the Pacific trench.
  - Traces of divine tissue found in energy deposits, fleshwarped zones, or experimental laboratories.
- The Flesh does **not think like a person**. Its actions are **instinctual**, not strategic. It acts through urges, reflexes, and cellular memory.

---

## 🧬 Properties and Powers

- **Flesh Warping** — Its signature trait. The ability to reshape organic matter, mutate tissue, and transform creatures. This includes both monstrous warping and adaptive regeneration.
- **Vital Absorption** — Many flesh-based constructs or descendants have the ability to draw in energy from other living beings (not to be confused with Roz’s gift to Violet).
- **Possession / Melding** — When hosted in a vessel (like the CEO), the Flesh can begin to express more coordinated thought, though never truly becomes “intelligent.”
- **Hive Logic** — The Flesh creates clones, amalgams, or semi-aware spawn to act in its interest without central cognition.

## 🧎‍♂️ The CEO: Host and False Mind

- The CEO was once human, exposed to the core mass of the Flesh through corporate excavation.
- He became its **avatar**, slowly consumed until the Flesh replaced his mind with a synthetic facsimile built on memory, instinct, and god-stuff.
- Now operates as a kind of **thinking tumor**, seeking to control the world using the tools of human civilization (money, biotech, empire) for the Flesh’s growth.
- Not truly in control. The **Flesh still drives** — the CEO merely narrates it.

---

## 🧬 Influence on the World

- May be responsible for **early mutations**, **Devil births**, and **post-apocalyptic regenerative outbreaks**.
- Has reshaped entire ecosystems, turning cities or continents into living, pulsing masses of semi-organic terrain.
- Appears **resistant to containment**; even metals or biotech designed to isolate it eventually fail unless maintained by Pattern-based architecture.

---

## 📛 False Attribution Clarification

- The powers of **Withering and Blooming** — often associated with vitality theft and energy redirection — **do not originate** from the Flesh.
- These powers were **gifted to Violet by Roz**, and while the Flesh may exhibit similar symptoms (absorption, bloom-like growth), it is fundamentally different in origin and intent.
- **Roz’s mutation is clever and elegant**; the Flesh’s is **brutal, instinctive, and contagious**.

---

## 🦴 Known Weaknesses

- **Star Metal**: One of the only materials capable of impeding or damaging the Flesh at the divine level.
- **Cold Logic / The Pattern**: Structures and systems that impose strict recursion can disrupt its growth or trap it in loops.
- **Roz’s Chaos**: May destabilize it unpredictably.

---

## 🧟‍♂️ Flesh-Created Beings

- **Demons**: High-tier, semi-intelligent monsters formed from warped humans or hybridized flesh constructs.
- **Devils**: The failed divine children bred by the CEO’s empire. Each one mutated, failed, or was consumed by the very flesh they were designed to control.
- **Fleshbeasts**: Masses of teeth, meat, limbs — unthinking, self-replicating horrors.

---

## 📚 Known Locations & Artifacts

- **Pacific Trench (Unmarked Coordinates)** — Believed to contain the skull-fragment or brain-node of the Flesh.
- **The Demonwastes / “Demon Fields”** — Vast corrupted zones where flesh structures reproduce out of control.
- **CEO Biolabs** — Corp-controlled temples/labs growing flesh in vats for war, consumption, and apotheosis attempts.

---

## ❗ Speculation

- The Flesh may not even be “the same being” across all its parts. Each fragment may have developed its own personality, instinct, or agenda.
- The CEO might be trying to **merge all pieces into a single will** — not realizing that doing so might erase him entirely.
- Some believe the Flesh is already **winning**, not through war, but **through normalization** — making its influence indistinguishable from everyday life.
