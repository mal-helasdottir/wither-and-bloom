The screen flickers with a plastic rustle. A corner hexagon is the first to give steady illumination, and the artificial light spreads across the stack from that point as ripples in a disturbed pond.

The knot in Violet’s stomach tightens further. She didn’t think it possible as her guts have been in a permanent state of duress since she awoke in a smoking ruin short one eye, but it managed all the same.

"Silent attention! Silent attention! The Chief Disciplinary Officer will speak and all shareholders shall hear!"

An image appears of a beautiful blonde man with perfect blue eyes above an incongrously foul expression, as if someone off camera has decided to wallow in liquid shit. 

Another one of her siblings has come up in the world it seems.

The image widens to show another clutch of three or four people crowded around a darker sagging shape, a man upon his knees, head down and arms outstretched, secured upright by yet more of her siblings.

Her entire body turns to ice, only managing to smother a sharp gasp by pure willpower.

"This monster—this animal—" one of the restrainers here launches a thick glob of spit that smacks the prisoner on the side of his head, "This whistleblower has committed atrocities. He has abducted and besmirched our prodigy. He has spread disinformation and fear. He has attempted to impede the invisible hand and thereby lower the sum of our values."

The crowd around Violet roars with boos and hissing, all of them drunk on the show and not a one doing any actual discernment.

Her brother, the speaker, and it irks at her that she cannot recall which brother it is, aims a swift boot to the prisoner’s ribs. The meaty *thunk* of struck flesh transmits clearly through the screen and the crowd seems to drink it in, magnify it, and spread the resulting murderous glee between each other like a contagion.

The prisoner lifts his face, mouth agape, struggling to get air and Violet knows that face too. A wild face with a scruffy chin and too many teeth. That face had kissed her, had told her everything would be alright.

He was wrong. Felix had been wrong.

She can’t even hear what’s being said anymore. She can’t feel the push and pull of a crowd in the throes of blood madness.

She only knows the ragged sound of his wet breaths, each one a struggle, a victory for every one swallowed past broken, bleeding, and bruised tissues as if his own body rebelled at the idea of him taking another lungful. She watches his clearly visible rib cage rise and fall with excruciating slowness, his limbs tremble under the slightest weight.

They’ve been starving him. Beating him. Letting him slowly heal and then doing it all again. For him to look this terrible he must be reaching the end of all his energy and all his hope.

And yet… The camera catches a flash of fangs, Felix’s grin hitches up on one side and he stares into the camera—though it remains resolutely focused on her brother reading the list of charges.

Violet feels she might cry. Or vomit. Or cry tears of vomit.

Then he begins speaking in müte cant, audible over the CDO and the rumbling crowd, "*Don’t try to rescue me, love. I’d rather die than see you get caught*." His grin widens, "*So if you come—don’t get caught. Or I’ll kill you myself*."

Her heart twists with love and no small amount of annoyance. Of course he would attempt to issue her directions and advice while in captivity and through a screen, no less.

He struggles against his captors, trying to pull away and get closer to the camera. Pandemonium erupts both in the crowd and on the broadcast. The picture cuts out but the sound is still on: bodies moving quickly, shuffling feet, the flat smack and *oof* of a gut punch landing, while Felix yells clearly over the entire milieu.

"Ya motherfuckers got no idea how fucked ya are! Not a fucking clue, not—Get your hands off me pretty boy—She’ll come and kill ya every last one of ya! She’ll bring everything down around ya clueless fucks brick by brick! The whole world gonna be a funeral pyre for ya sons of demon whores and when the burnin is done we’re gonna fuck on the greasy ashes. I’m gonna—No don’t ya fuck—"

Finally, mercifully, the sound ends as well. 

And Violet knows what she needs to do.
