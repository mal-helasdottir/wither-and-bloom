# Frontier and [[04 groups/mutants\|Mute]] Towns

## Battery City
Mute ”Capital“. Home of the Anti-Zion Resistance, AKA Babylon to the [[04 groups/the corporate fellowship\|Corpos]]
## UFO Town
Formerly Roswell New Mexico, Center of town is remains of the International UFO and Research Museum, which is the seat of government (Mayor and Sheriff most like).  Under the Museum is a secret facility run by the Men in Black and the [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|acolytes of the infinite pattern]].  The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] and MiBs are the true leaders of the town and most who end up in government are either converts or controlled.

Most steer clear of the odd Lanky Boys and their base, and some pretend its not there even though most smugglers and waste runners know its there because of the stories of people that go missing around there and of the Lanky boys that are sometimes seen coming and going from that direction.  Most smart waste runners and scavs steer clear.  

## The Monastery (working title, could be The Grand Library or something similar as well)
Home of the enigmatic [[04 groups/the brotherhood of gnosis\|Brotherhood of Gnosis]].  Typically only brothers and sisters of the order are allowed to tread these sacred halls.  This should be the remains of a large library or university. TBD as to which
