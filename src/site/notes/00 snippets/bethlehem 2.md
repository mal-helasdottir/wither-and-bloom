# bethlehem 2 >> sequel to bethlehem

Another eternal hall. Brushed metal walls with brushed metal doors set neatly two by two as far as he can see. The drips and smears of blood and plant ash however, don’t bother adhering to any kind of order, festooned at random as they are—except for how they cluster around the first set of two doors.

Little plaques reside beside each door at eye level and bear a set of squiggles Felix can’t parse. He chews his cheek for a moment, sharp canines sinking into flesh without leaving marks, then fishes a bit of crumpled white from his patched coat pocket. With one hand he spreads it over the wall, eyes darting between the now three sets of squiggles and playing *spot the difference*. 

The first bit is the same on plaques and paper, every detail matches from the first snakey shape all the way to the last of seven, a tall one with a cross piece. Like a wide roof over a very skinny hovel or a headless müte with arms outstretched.

For the next bit his paper looks like… Well breasts. Or a nice shapely bottom. For a brief second he tries to recall the last time he was able to indulge in company with ample breasts and bottoms. *Too long,* he grumbles aloud to the doors, who doubtless have little interest in the sexual escapades of a müte.

Or lack thereof.

In any case the first door doesn’t have tits or ass, it’s more like a tent? Sort of pointy? No, rounder. Maybe? Like the top of old Winnie before unfolding her for a night stop.

The second door though, that’s the winner because not only is it impressively endowed on the front it’s just four runes long against the other plaques five.

Confident he opens the second and strides through, to the cell marked "*Subject Beta*" and leaving shut the other labeled "*Subject Alpha*."
