# the ceo

Adam, or the CEO is the primary antagonist of the story.  His original name has been largely forgotten, only the most dedicated scholars of the Brotherhood of Gnosis who seek and record the lost histories of man have uncovered it and his True story.  He was born David Fischer Jr.  and was the son of an oil and gas mogul David Fischer head of the Fischer Energy.  Much to the chagrin of his father Jr. grew to be an environmentalist and studied biology and marine biology.  He worked for the NOAA.  He spent time studying the strange wildlife that was only found in a deep ocean trench within the Gulf of Mexico. It was on a deep exploration of the trench that he discovered a remnant of the Fallen Flesh near its bottom.  He became increasingly obsessed with the strange substance.   He knew from his contact with the flesh he needed to go deeper.  When NOAA refused to allow him to drill as it would harm the ecosystem he quit and reconciled with the father and took over the company.  Using his government connections and the substantial wealth his company afforded he paid the right senators and lawmakers to get the protections on the area lifted and exclusive drilling rights granted to his company.

He began extracting the Flesh from the trench, which he marketed as a super oil, the substance that would solve the world energy crisis. Due to the Crisis Liquid Night was pushed through and past regulations rather quickly and soon energy grids, vehicles and most anything that ran on oil or gas was being converted to burn Liquid Night instead.  The substance is crazy efficient as a drop can power a neighborhood for a month and keep a car running for a year.  (or something crazy).  

This made Fischer Energy the richest and most powerful company in the world.  They rebranded themselves as Eden Energy, and David Fischer Jr. was almost worshiped as a savior. 

Unbeknownst to the mass population however, these remains of a “dead” god being spread and used as they were started spread its influence and awaken its power.  David as the first to discover it and become obsessed felt the pull first.  He had secretly uncovered a portion the Fallen Flesh’s skull and several petrified eyes of varying sizes.  A few sharp teeth as well.  He had several of these objects and splinters of bone transported to his office in Austin Texas.  He was the first human to ingest the flesh as well and began piercing his flesh with bone and as understanding grew so too did madness.  He locked himself away in his office and his only contact with the outside world for a time were rambling tweets and posts to social media often criticizing his detracters or rambling on about conspiracy theories.  His accounts are quickly silenced by tothers in his company/family.

Its discovered during this isolation that Liquid Night also functions as a drug, its effects are similar to that of Meth, burst of energy and feeling unstoppable.  After a Decade of wide spread use the first mutants begin to be born.  

Panic ensues when its discovered Liquid Night is to blame for these strange births and other blizzard happenings as exposure to it has started to affect animals and plants as well

The Acolytes of the Pattern decide they must take action soon and they begin acquiring nuclear weapons and all of their followers are evacuated into space.  Several senators and prominent government officials around the world start relocating to the lunar or mars colonies.  

This is also when David returns to the public eye declaring himself Adam the first human and soon to be god.  He then begins the ritual he learned through his madness by ingesting the eyes and attempting to become the Avatar of the Fallen Flesh.  He does this atop his skyscraper in Austin

A human body is not made to hold a god, and so as soon as the ritual finishes it starts going bad.  Adam’s form begins to flesh warp spontaneously and threats to tear itself apart. Several gobs of Flesh fly free from his form and land in various parts of the US which would eventually grow to become the Demon Fields.  He manages to regain control but only buy devoting nearly all of his godly power to holding himself together. He must use 98% of his divine power to keep himself held together in a “Mostly” human form… one forever altered though.  2% of a gods power is more than anyone else on the planet has though, so he figures it is enough until he is able to devise a way to stabilize himself.

The acolytes of the pattern, who ware watching via satellite  waits until the ritual nearly finishes to act.  They had hoped with our fail, but when Adam starts to regain control they fire two nukes.  One at the trench the the Gulf, and another at the Eden Energy Headquarters in Austin. 

This triggers a chain of chaotic events that lead to global nuclear war as no one is able to determine who fired the nukes and so everyone ends up firing back at everyone else.  This drastically reduces the world population, creates fall out, etc etc. 

Adam uses his newfound powers to erect a dome of flesh to protect Austin from the attack. The black dome remains in place for several years until the area around Austin is more safe to traverse.  

In that time the people in the city being to revere the CEO as their god and savior and the religion around the Eden Energy is formed.  Austin is renamed Zion, and whent he dome comes down to reveal the wasteland around them the CEO and his forces are ready to move out and lay claim to what remains of civilization.
