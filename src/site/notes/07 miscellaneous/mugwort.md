# mugwort
[[07 miscellaneous/absynth\|artemisia absinthium]]'s humble cousin, [artemisia vulgaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_vulgaris)
- it is notoriously difficult to kill by ploughing under, as the separated parts will germinate
- said to guard travelers against heatstroke, exhaustion, and wild animals (st. john the baptist wore a girdle of it for this purpose) and when worn by women it warded evil sprits
- was once used to flavor beer instead of hops
- the ukrainian word чорнобиль (chornóbyl), meaning *black stalk* is used for this plant. the nuclear power station was named for it. yes that chernobyl. [^1]

- used to make inhalable relaxants. alone it can be used for lucid dreaming and with the addition of certain other plants can induce prophetic visions in those with the propensity for it
