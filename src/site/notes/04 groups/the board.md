# the board
[[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s original fanboys
his closest confidants
the leaders and progenitors of the great houses of [[04 groups/corporate empire of zion\|imperial zion]]
closest to the ceo in age and power, but without being puppeted by [[04 groups/The Eldest Ones#the fallen flesh\|an elder god]]

## ideas?
- 12 because there were 12 apostles
- one is judas, who is more like the president of district 13 in hunger games than like actual judas
- likely each from a different country, possibly the greatest world powers at the time? since this is an alternate timeline how closely that list would adhere to reality is up for debate
- i think they could each have an ethnic first name, perhaps the most popular name for babies of x gender in that country when they were born then they adopt as a second name the name of one of the original apostles, since the ceo is the second coming and all that
