# # Mutants

Mutants — or mutes — are human-animal hybrids created through the influence of [[03 people/the diminished one\|Roz]] and her chaos magic. They are not the result of radiation or scientific experimentation; they are Roz's answer to the Revelation, a way to preserve life by making it adaptable, unpredictable, and impossible to systematize.

## Origin

Mutation set in over generations following the Revelation. [[03 people/the diminished one\|Roz]] intervened to protect the survivors — not out of kindness, but because it was funny to make the Flesh's job harder.

She gave early mutants animalistic adaptations (tails, feathers, gills, etc.) as a way to make them **resistant to corruption by the Fallen Flesh**. The animal DNA scrambles something in the way the Flesh tries to absorb and warp living tissue. Roz's gifts were not curses. They were armor.

She also made previously incompatible DNA capable of hybridizing without producing sterile offspring — ligers and mules are sterile, but mutes are not. The mutations are random and don't follow strict genetic logic; a "land animal" hybrid can be born to "sea animal" parents. It's magic. It's chaos. It doesn't have to make scientific sense.

Mutants are, in a sense, Roz's living "fuck you" to both the Pattern (too chaotic to systematize) and the Flesh (too scrambled to consume cleanly).

## Hybrid Types

Mutants loosely group themselves by the animal characteristics they display. This is flavor, not caste — no social hierarchy is based on type.

**Land hybrids**: Grey or brown skin, dark hair, green or golden or deep brown eyes. Tend toward sturdy builds.

**Sky hybrids**: Pale blue, peach, or lavender skin. Lighter eyes. Tall and willowy.

**Sea hybrids**: Jewel tones and bright colors like tropical fish. 

Types don't breed true. Two land hybrids will *probably* make a land hybrid, but sometimes no. A hybrid with atypical coloring — like a sky hybrid with land coloring — might be considered special or marked for something.

<!-- FLOATED: some types may tend toward dark sclera; body builds vary -->

## Physical Culture

### Touch Etiquette

It's common mutant courtesy not to touch another mutant's animal features unless invited. Like how you don't touch other people's daemons. Tails, ears, feathers, fins — these are intimate. Touching them without consent is a violation.

For some mutants, certain features are erogenous zones. For others, they're simply personal. Either way: don't assume, don't grab, don't ask to pet someone you just met.

### Affection & Body Attitudes

Mutants are physically affectionate people. Hugs, hand-holding, kisses on cheeks as greetings — they're touchy in the way big families are touchy.

Free mutes are far less prudish about bodies than corpos. Communal bathing is common in Battery City. Nudity isn't inherently sexual or shameful. ("It's a dick, what do you want? At least it's not pointing right now — that would be rude.")

Corpo mutes, by contrast, are conditioned to cover themselves at all times. New arrivals to Battery City often keep wearing their masks in public — haven't adjusted yet. Easy to spot. A "sprout icon" in the wild.

## Masks

Masks are a loaded symbol in mute culture — tools of oppression turned into identity, rebellion, and survival.

### Corpo Mutes

In corpo cities like [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#jericho\|Jericho]], mutants are required to wear masks at all times in public. No exceptions.

- **Standard issue**: Blank, featureless face coverings. Minimal accommodation for physical mutations (a slight bend for a beak, etc.)
- **Military**: Masks include barcodes or QR codes so human officers can scan and identify individual mutes; otherwise they look identical
- **Social caste**: Based on how well a mute can be covered. Hole in your mask for a beak? You're never working anywhere anyone can see that.
- **Work vs casual**: Work masks are uniform; mutes may have personal masks for off-hours, decorated as one of the few forms of self-expression allowed

### Free Mutes (Wasteland / Resistance)

Wasteland mutes don't *need* masks — but many still wear them.

- **Practical**: Dusty out there; good for anonymity during jobs
- **Symbolic**: A reclaimed tool of oppression; "fuck you" to the corpos
- **Personal expression**: Varied, chaotic, colorful, not always practical. Bioshock masks, Venetian masks, theatrical Japanese/Hindu styles — whatever they want. They're the punks in biopunk.
- **Defaced corpo masks**: Defectors may keep their old masks with a cross through the barcode or a big red X through the blank face. Keeps them anonymous while showing allegiance.
- **Military surplus**: Gas masks with metal components swapped out for ceramics
- **Recognition**: Free mutes know each other by mask, scent, or sound depending on mutation — more organized than they look, which throws off corpos who don't get it

<!-- FLOATED: "Die with your mask on" as resistance mantra (Danger Days reference) -->

### Battery City & Settled Towns

Many free mutes in established settlements don't wear masks day-to-day. New arrivals from corpo towns often still do — a visible sign they haven't deprogrammed yet.

## Naming Conventions

### Corpo Mutes

Children are often named after the first letter of their barcode identifier. Felix's barcode was `8942F5`, so his parents named him Felix. His mother Nikki was `5826N3`. His father Alex was `4374A7`.

### Free Mutes

Names come from remnants of the old world: road signs, billboards, old books, brand names, city names, 90s pop culture detritus. "New Coke." "Longview." "Parachute." "Scrunchie." "JNCO." "Sarsaparilla."

Not everyone has a ridiculous capitalism name, but enough do to make it obvious: they preserve history and culture, but they don't *quite* grok the subtleties.

The [[04 groups/the brotherhood of gnosis\|Brotherhood]] keeps records of families and names for mutes who want to remember. They hold the genealogies. They help people stay connected across generations.
