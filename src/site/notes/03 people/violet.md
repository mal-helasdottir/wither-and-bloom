- self-loathing

### positive traits:

violet, while genetically and spiritually rose's twin, is considered the black sheep and elevated to second purely for her strong connection with rose. of course there's also her ability to fight for extended periods with makeshift weapons from melee or range, with cover or without, and even accomplish assassinations, espionage, and other high stealth ops.

there are a number of quirks to her personality, a result of being raised as an experiment amongst other experiments rather than as a child with a loving family.
- instant distrust if your name has an even number of syllables
	- magical thinking with shades of ocd/anxiety
- zealous attachment and protectiveness of anything considered *wrong* or *broken*
	- this is empathy as these things are extensions of or stand ins for herself
- expects criticism, demeaning remarks, and punishment over small infractions to be a matter of course
	- high tolerance for pain, mistreatment, and abuse
- struggles with expressing intense emotion in healthy ways
	- disassociation
	- depression
	- anger
	- substance abuse
	- withdrawal/avoidance
- yearns for intimacy, love, and companionship as an equal but cannot understand or uphold the tenants that such a relationship requires
	- sex is meaningless other than as a transaction or bargaining chip
	- believes she is unworthy and undeserving of care
	- anyone spending a lot of time with her is only after something they want
