## the gods 
### [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the flesh]]
- *body*, mother mother
	- the way the flesh is offered up and consumed by lesser beings after her power, [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]'s mirroring of these actions as he creates minions, the cannibalistic nature of [[04 groups/demons\|demons]] and devils and a little tongue and cheek reference to catholic eucharist. t
- *vore*, sleep token
	- this entire song is fucking peak flesh and its very hard to choose a bit to focus on but i think it's worth mentioning there's just as much material here for the [[02 history/the playlist#the ceo\|ceo]] as there is for the flesh. i think the ceo has always felt lonely and misunderstood. power as a way to get attention and validation and in a way the flesh is the same? *your viscera welcome me in, welcome me in. my life is torn, my bones, they bleed. my metaphors fall short in the end. your flesh and bone welcome me in, welcome me in. are you in pain like I am?* perhaps becoming a horrible tetsuo-like fleshgamation is a comfort to both of them--pity they chose violence after that tho. t
### [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the pattern]]
- *starman*, david bowie
	- extremely innocent take on the infinite pattern, making her seem gentle, interested, positive, etc. she's not any of those things but *let the children boogie*, as they say. t
- *hypnosis*, sleep token
- *algorithm*, muse
### [[03 people/The Diminished One\|the diminished]]
- *aspiring fires*, mother mother
	- fire - chaotic, ravenous, uncontrollable, viral, nonsensical. *you wanna see me crazy? well i'll show you it's like and then i'll wave goodbye as you run for your life*. *a little advice for aspiring fires: you get put out if you don't get a little wild*. *because crazy in the box is everything that crazy's not*. t
- *string break song*, charming disaster
	- there is no living without destruction. nothing lasts forever. every day takes you one more closer to the last. *chaos is gonna win in the end, the universe is flying apart, there ain't nothing much you can do about it. burn up the candle or live in the dark*? t
- *alkaline*, sleep token
	- *not acid nor alkaline, caught between black and white, not quite either day or night, {they're} perfectly misaligned*. chaos is all those things and none of those things. *i'm caught up in {their} design and how it connects to mine*. the ultimate plan (that's not a plan, really) to save the universe by introducing a little nonsense and cutting the knees out from under power. *every once in a while something changes and {they're} changing me. it's too late for me now, i am altered--there is something beneath*. the something being secrets implanted beneath skin and bone, the mutations that allow beloveds to shirk the control of **their** more powerful siblings and change the fate of the world. t
- *black sheep* metric
	- our common goal was waiting for the world to end, now the truth is just a rule that you can bend, you crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again.  *changing the rules and changing their shape helps everyone and no one, chaos is also very much THE black sheep of the gods, the diminished half doubly so*

## [[03 people/the ceo\|the ceo]]
- *young god*, halsey
- *everybody wants to rule the world*, lorde
- *we had it all*, pim stones
- *necromancin dancin*, bear ghost
- *mx sinister*, i don't know how but they found me
- *you'd be paranoid too*, water parks
- *enemy*, imagine dragons
- *modern day cain*, i don't know how but they found me
- *pet*, a perfect circle
## [[03 people/violet\|violet]]
- *anything like me*, poppy
	- [[09 dynamics/rose x violet\|rose x violet]]
	- *i feel her heart beating in me. get her out of me.* the experience of having [[03 people/rose\|rose]] for a sister and then absorbing part of her, who isn't impressed with violet trying to take her place or abandoning the whole thing. *i'm everything she never was now everyone's out for my blood. stop you're making a scene. you're coming at me with blood in your teeth*. t
- *bleed magic*, i don't know how but they found me
- *build god, then we'll talk*, panic! at the disco
- *delicate weapon*, grimes
- *magdalena*, a perfect circle
	- yes it's a song about a stripper or prostitute and that usually what violet/stel is but hear me out. it's also an explicit reference to mary of [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion#magdala\|magdala]] (was she a prostitute or the favorite disciple? to the asshole men who wrote and translated the bible what's even the difference?), who violet is specifically modeled after in w&b. further it's about giving anything beyond reason in service of earthly pleasure, which violet has had done to her and engaged in herself--greed is her worst sin. *i'd sell my soul, my self-esteem, a dollar at a time. one chance, one kiss, one taste of you my magdalena*. t
## [[03 people/felix\|felix]]
- *i wanna be yours*, arctic monkeys
	- *secrets i have held in my heart are harder to hide than i thought*. bro wants to be her electric meter and her ford cortina because he won't ever rust. particularly cute because the prevalence of [[06 concepts/the forging of metals\|rust]] in this universe makes him never doing as such particularly valuable. t
- *sugar*, sleep token
	- *i've developed a taste for you now sugar*. this song makes me pregnant, therefore it's a fel song. t
- *choke*, i don't know how but they found me
- *whose ready for tomorrow*, ibdy and rat boy
- *do it all the time*, i don't know how but they found me
	- we're talomg over the world one kiss at a time and then i'm taking your girl and i'm making her mine. *fel's fuck you to the ceo*
- *panther like a panther*, run the jewels

## miscellaneous
## rose
- *anything like me*, poppy
	- *you'll never be anything like me. you shouldn't be anything like me.* t
## demons
## devil princes
