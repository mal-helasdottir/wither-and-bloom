# morning routine
#snippet #waifu

a sickly sunbeam creeps into violet's eyes, slow and deliberate, as if determined to wake her in the rudest way possible. she pinches her brows, wondering who turned the light up so early and for what reason they believed they could do so without repercussions. 

then she remembers. 

driving all day across the wastes, outrunning the wyrmwind, then the men in black. felix maintaining a steady prattle about the merits of a "mikal jacksim" as opposed to one "david bowhee," as if either of those concepts mean anything to her. her eyelids growing heavy even though her instincts scream that she must stay awake and vigilant. falling asleep on this bed anyway, while watching roswell lazily dart a little pink tongue between spread toe beans without a care in the world.

she remains still in the bed, fighting the inexorable pull of consciousness. she isn't in eden anymore. she may never be again. thinking on it makes her throat hurt and her nose run, so she stops.

a rustling comes from the sofa, then a plaintive, rasping *mrow*. "sorry roz," felix whispers in his distinctive yat, "go back ta sleep."

the man moves about within the 'winnie' with care, trying not to wake her, violet supposes. she keeps her eyes shut, maintaining a decent enough impression of sleep. well enough to fool felix anyway, who's terrible at the whole quiet thing. there's quite a bit more rustling, the soft *clink* of a ceramic catch being released, a hollow plastic scrape as if stacked bowls are being slid about and finally the creak and click of a door opening and closing behind.

her eyes fly open. did he just go outside? she sits up, hand going to the back of her neck out of habit, looking to remove the tether from her spine and feeling a sort of stomach-hollowing bereavement at finding nothing. 

the light that woke her slants cherrily across the sofa, the bed, and an unholy assortment of rumpled clothing on the floor. roz is still here, hugging back legs to their chest with their other sets of legs. it doesn't look comfortable, but it must be, otherwise the beast wouldn't bother doing it. no sign of the man.

has she been abandoned? surely not? felix wouldn't leave winnie, an item with value, behind would he? he doesn't strike her as that kind of person.

thinking about it makes her feel strange again in a way that's difficult to parse--her stomach flops, her skin prickles, and her hands feel cold.

perhaps not the last though, it is somewhat cool in here.

movement outside the thick window catches her attention. she gathers a blanket around her shoulders after the fashion of her cloaks in eden, and moves to look outside.

she's greeted by a bare ass, gray and scarred, a long sleek black tail resting atop the perky cheeks. further there's a gray back, also bare and scarred. then some lean, muscled legs and broad shoulders crowned by a sheet of beautiful, straight, blue black hair, the ends dyed a faded red. felix, clad only in unlaced boots, staring out across the wastes at an unmolested expanse of shining white.

her mouth goes dry. by father's own mercy, what--?

felix flops forward into the white, ruining the pristine surface with his image. 

*snow* she realizes. the white is snow. 

he turns onto his back and starts gathering drifts of the stuff onto himself, rubbing handfuls of it into his dusky skin. he sits up, leaving an exaggerated imprint to smooth snow on his neck, behind his long, tufted ears, between fingers, armpits...

he's cleaning himself, she muses. the thought brings heat to her face and an inability to avert her gaze. *i met him less than a day ago and im spying on him while he has a bath.*

felix looks up and a long moment passes in which violet regrets every decision she has ever made and felix's face splits in a grin that displays all his numerous and rather sharp-looking teeth.

"ya want a bath now's the time. it'll start meltin' away soon and there won't be another chance 'till tomorrow, maybe even day after." impossibly the grin gets wider, eyes twinkling as some abominable idea occurs to him. "ya can join me if ya want. i can get ya back for ya."

*and there it is*, thinks violet. embarrassment gone with the arrival of irritation, violet stomps to the door and flings it wide, ignoring when roz skitters past her and tunnels into the snow beside felix like some kind of worm, "i don't need my back 'got'. i don't need a bath. and i certainly don't want any of that happening with you."

his eyes grow heavy, amused, "sure, ya say that now, but ain't one lady yet been born that can resist ol' fel."

violet grabs a large bowl from the counter, ensures it's clean, then exits winnie to scoop snow inside it. "incorrect. i was born some time ago," she snaps. bowl full she returns inside the vehicle with her prize and her dignity, closing the door smartly on the man's lopsided, know-it-all smile.

she waits for the snow to melt, stewing. infuriating man.
