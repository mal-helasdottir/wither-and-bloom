# Semi-Canon: Ankai / Anunnaki

## Taxonomy
- Annunaki + Annunaki = Annunaki
- Annunaki + Human = Ankai
- Ankai + Human = diluted hybrid (“Anks” — placeholder term)
- Gen 3 = Anunnaki great-grandparent (e.g. Cid)
- Gen 4 = great-great-grandparent (most Brotherhood)

## Physical Traits
- Ankai:
  - Slightly taller
  - Glowing/vibrant eyes
  - White/silver/grey hair
- Full Anunnaki:
  - Bald, black eyes, pale
  - Long limbs, vestigial noses
  - Cybernetic and uploaded minds

# Semi-Canon: Brotherhood of Gnosis

## Origins
- Possibly founded by Gen 3 Ankai who broke away from the Pattern.
- Serve as monks, technicians, language-keepers, and philosophical resistors.

## Behavior
- Have hidden monasteries, some of which are converted Anunnaki sites (e.g. “Area 51” vibe).
- Cid’s likely base is near Battery City, in a “hill monastery.”

# Semi-Canon: Events

## Brotherhood Infrastructure
- The Brotherhood of Gnosis maintains both:
  - Traditional **monasteries** (monk-coded)
  - Alien-tech **“Area 51” strongholds** (Anunnaki-coded)
- Cid likely lives in a monastery bunker near Battery City.
- Aesthetic compromise reflects husband-and-user canon fusion.
## Epilogue Premonition
- **Series Two epilogue**: Cid and the Oracle (Opal) are in space near Saturn.
  - Opal wakes from a premonitory sleep and warns Cid.
  - They witness an **eye opening in the center of Saturn’s hexagon**.

## Language Abilities
- **Cid learns the mutant language (Mute)** instantly through pattern mimicry.
  - Quote: “You did. Just now.”
- Felix is surprised and mildly annoyed; Cid attributes it to his Ankai brain.

## Violet’s Black Blood (Tentative)
- Violet may have **black blood** after Eden.
- Felix considers leaving her due to fear of demonic transformation.
- This drives him to seek out the Brotherhood (Cid) for answers.
## Wedding & Combat
- **Cid officiates** Felix and Violet’s wedding **mid-battle** in Book Two.
  - Tone and dialogue snippets confirm it.
  - Scene likely includes combat, surprise, and emotional payoff.

## Workshop Geography
- **Felix keeps multiple hidden workshops**:
  - In Battery City
  - In mute slums
  - In wasteland towns
- They’re booby-trapped. Cid knows about at least one of them.

# Semi-Canon: Felix

## Possible Emotional Beats
- Briefly considers abandoning Violet in a field after Eden due to comatose state and visible black blood.
- Wonders if she is turning into a demon.
- Contemplates taking her to the Brotherhood to ask Cid what’s wrong.
- Knows Cid by reputation; associates him with mutants, monks, and forbidden knowledge.

## Language
- Learns Mute slowly through immersion.
- Cid learns it instantly; Felix is annoyed.# title

# Semi-Canon: Structure

## Reader Knowledge Timing
- The reader learns early (possibly via prologue/intermezzo) that **Devil Princes are failed Prodigy candidates**.
- This foreshadows Cid and Opal’s eventual discovery, increasing narrative tension and comprehension.
## Series Framework
- The story is structured as a **trilogy of trilogies**:
  - **Series One**: Felix & Violet (Books 1–3)
  - **Series Two**: Cid & Opal (Books 4–6)
  - **Series Three**: Rosemary (their daughter) & her pseudo-Ankai partner (Books 7–9)

# Semi-Canon: Violet

## Physical/Medical
- May have **black blood** early on (uncertain canon status).
- May have scared Felix early enough to nearly get left behind.
- Reacts to Cid’s mental field differently than to Lanky Boys — unclear if because of familiarity, affinity, or other reason.

## Fighting Style
- Guerilla, scrappy.
- Bounces, throws dirt, bites, shoves.
- She leaps. Very bouncy
