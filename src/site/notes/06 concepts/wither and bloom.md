# Wither and Bloom

*A unique energy transference ability — rooted in chaos, born from [[03 people/the diminished one\|Roz]], wielded by [[03 people/violet\|Violet]].*

---

## 1. Origin, Function, and Ground Rules

**Wither and Bloom** is not a mutation of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]] nor a standard deviant ability. It is a **gift from Roz**, [[03 people/the diminished one\|the diminished one]], passed uniquely into [[03 people/violet\|Violet]]. This power functions as a chaotic, non-flesh-derived energy exchange: Violet draws life-force from others (Wither), and may later restore, redirect, or weaponize it (Bloom).

It is a consequence of Violet’s **deliberate genetic engineering**—she was designed to absorb and store divine or god-corrupted energy **without warping or dying** like her experimental siblings. This capacity makes her **a living battery**, but it is **Roz**, not the Empire or the Flesh, who grants her the *power* to reroute and repurpose that energy.

**Ground Rules:**
- **Touch is required** to initiate either withering or blooming.
- **No consent is needed** — the power is mechanistic, not spiritual or moral.
- **Energy can be stored** inside Violet temporarily.
- **Extended hoarding is dangerous**, though limits remain undefined.
- These powers are **not Flesh-derived** — the mechanics differ from fleshwarping or demonic mutation.

## 2. Withering

> “She can drain the life force from one thing, turning it into a lifeless husk... eventually withering it to dust.”

**Withering** is the act of drawing out vital energy from a living source. The effects vary depending on what’s targeted:
- A small organism may die instantly.
- A human could be rendered unconscious or dead.
- Demons or other godspawn yield volatile, powerful energy.

Withered energy can be:
- **Stored internally** (boosting Violet’s strength or vitality),
- **Redirected outward** (as a concussive or telekinetic blast),
- **Reserved for blooming** (healing, resurrection, etc.).

> ⚠️ *Speculation:* It is believed the failed siblings ("Devils") may have had similar energy-absorbing potential, but lacked Violet’s stability. Their exposure to this same power caused them to mutate, combust, or descend into monstrous states.

> ⚠️ *Clarification:* Withering may cause unpredictable effects in fleshwarped creatures — spasms, decay acceleration, even forced stasis — but **Violet is not a fleshwarper**, and cannot command their tissue with intent.

## 3. Blooming

> “She could also use it to heal others, make plant life grow... maybe even pyrokinesis.”

**Blooming** is the restoration or release of stolen life-force:
- **Heals wounds**
- **Revives wilted plant life**
- **Temporarily boosts allies’ strength or speed**
- **Channels stored energy outward** in violent or explosive form

Violet first discovers she can bloom **outwardly** during a crisis — attempting to revive her sister Rose. This moment confirms the power isn't solely internal or selfish: it can **change the world**, not just protect Violet.

> Roz does not grant power gently — blooming is both an act of rebellion and creation. It is *hope weaponized*.

## Notes

- *Wither and Bloom* remains a signature ability tied to Violet alone.
- The balance between withering and blooming reflects her arc: survival vs. sacrifice, destruction vs. nurture.
- Roz’s role in granting this power remains mysterious, but it is clearly **outside [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the Pattern]]’s logic** and **antithetical to [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]]’s hunger**.
