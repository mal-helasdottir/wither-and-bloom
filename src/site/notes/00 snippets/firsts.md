**battery city, feast of the all-martyr's**
#### *violet* --
there's something about [[01 inbox/felix\|him]], [[01 inbox/violet\|she]] thinks, for what must be the twentieth time just today.

something special.

something... she's staring, and he notices. locks eyes with her across the small crowd and the powdery rainbow clouds. he's covered in the colorful particles, they cling to him with a ghostly reverence, as if he's one of the martyred ancestors this entire celebration is for. the idea of fel being martyred hurts somehow, brings a burn to her eyes and pulls the corners of her mouth down.

always the contrarian, fel grins, widening slowly, growing brighter, like daybreak over the wastes. his fangs glitter in battery city's perpetual twilight, and his eyes are dark and deep, fixed on her.

always on her. she can't look away.

he strides over, still grinning in that sly, smug way of his, but she swears she can hear a too-fast pulse beneath the pink spattered cloth of his shirt, beneath the cage of his ribs. though perhaps she's simply hearing her own pulse. it's difficult to say. it's hard to focus. she can smell him too, snowfall and sweat and the LN he coats all his equipment with.

"vi," he says.

"fel," she replies.

"ya need somethin'?" impossibly, his expression becomes smarmier and her stomach does a flopping dance of betrayal. "ya awful clean... i can help with that."

before she can ask what he means, he lobs a hidden handful of bright blue dust in her face and *runs*.

#### *felix* --
she's following him.

he stifles a chuckle. a tail is normally a bad thing, but rather than the usual racing thoughts and pulse, the need to escape, there's a bubbling warmth in his chest and a smile tugging at his lips.

he doesn't bother evading her amongst the crowded festival stalls. instead he chooses to consider the merits of the various foods on offer. does he want a mushroom kebab or a fried meat-o platter with noodles? he lingers at a booth where hard candies glitter at him beneath their smokey ln wrappers. 

what would she like? something savory? protein? how hungry is she? is she hungry? maybe she'd just like a sweet.

she is fond of sweets. he recalls the sparkling eyes and greedy fingers the one time they uncovered a little sweetener in alien town, and he made them each a soft, fried bun sprinkled with the stuff. she'd stolen half of his. he didn't hold it against her.

he settles on a handful of the gem colored candy and a kebab, knowing her occasional reluctance to eat meat and resolving to eat it himself before getting her something else if she desires.

the warmth again. likely hungry. or heartburn.

she's still moving through the edges, a dark needle slipping between the thick weft of mutants at play. her hood is down and her long braid is coated with blue powder, as though she wiped the color off her face with it.

he finds a spot beneath the broad gills of a softly luminescing lilac bonnet and sits, awaiting her inevitable approach.

#### *violet* --
likely, he's noticed her, but she finds the spark of irritation that lead to the chase has sputtered out. now the grilled and spiced kebab in his hand looks almost as appealing as the empty seat beside him.

she slides into the open spot, taking the kebab and brushing her lips softly along his scruffy jaw with a "thanks."

he chuckles. "i was expectin' somethin' a little more violent."

violet sets to work upon her dinner with a noncommittal sort of grunt.

felix leans away, his tail finding her waist, to hand her a cup of some fermented beverage. he has one too and violet watches from the corner of her eye as he lifts it to his lips, throat bobbing with each swallow.

he's fascinating to her. 

she cannot recall when felix moved from *necessary annoyance* to *indispensable partner*. circumstances haven't changed: her father still believes he will become a god; rose is still lost in the wastes somewhere; demons, ankai, and psychopaths prowl relentlessly in search of fulfillment; everything is fucked and no one is safe -- least of all her.

and yet he's here. making sure she eats, sleeps, and knows the right people. in a fight, he's in her blind spots, keeping trouble at bay. right now the solid, slim loop of his tufted tail around her is a tether in a wyrmtempest. comfortable. companionable. she can relax, or at the least the closest she can get to *relaxed*.

it's... nice. violet curls against him as she finishes her dinner, fidgeting with the soft, warm fur beneath her fingertips.

#### *felix* --
his skin heats, a tingle racing up his spine at her gentle touch. he fights to keep his pulse steady and breathing even, covering anything he cant control by popping one of her candies in his mouth. "ya want one?"

she tilts her head and lets her mouth fall open, sticking out her pink tongue in expectation of a sweet.

he could unwrap one and place it on her tongue with reverence the way the corpos do in their holy mysteries. he'd never have to think too deeply about the consequences of feelings unspoken or needs unrequited.

or--

felix presses his mouth to hers, softly, tracing his tongue along her plump bottom lip. his thumb caresses the side of her throat where the skin is smoother than silk. she opens to him with a low murmur and the city fades away to nothing as she tentatively curls her tongue against his own. he groans at the intimate stroke, at the weight of her in his arms. then she steals the candy before he has the chance to slip it to her.

"thief," he grumbles, without heat. 

he doesn't let her go, but then she doesn't pull away either, even as he fishes around in his pocket.

"rogue," she replies, candy clacking against her teeth, fingers knitting over the slopes of his shoulders.

"ya love it though," he says, popping a replacement candy into his mouth.

she just watches him, thoughtful, her eyes wide and beautiful under the soft neon shrooms, the colors reflecting back at him like moonbeams on still water.

he lets the silence hang in the air, interested to see what she does with the reins in her hands.

"kiss me again, felix," she breathes and her voice is so soft and sweet he cannot help but oblige.

once.

twice.

more.

now that he's started he can't stop. the taste of her is liquid night and the headiest absynth. his kisses turn frantic, heavy, greedy, as though he needs his mouth against her to live. his heart flutters as she responds in kind for every groan and every murmur and sigh. he's panting hard, but so is she. her fingers locked into his messy hair. his hands skimming along the curves of her backside.

he wants her close. wants to make her his. wants --

"felix," she manages. 

he places more kisses along the side of her throat as he waits.

"i need you," she says, words ending in a whimper that electrifies his entire body. "i need you to touch me. i need you to--"

another kiss, this time to quiet her.

"sure," he says, leading her by the hand away from the festival and towards the quiet of the rest park. "anythin' ya need." she pads close behind and he pauses for yet another touch of her lips on his own. he's shocked and horrified he managed to live this long without kissing violet senseless. if that can even be called *living*.  "anythin' ya want buttercup. it's yours."

#### *violet* --

every step closer to the winnie brings felix closer to her.

it seems like he won't -- *or can't* -- keep himself away from her, and she would give anything to ensure he never stops. his big, warm hands with their rough calluses and incongruous gentleness that she's used to seeing cook food, or pet roz, fight with her... bandage her... now trace her curves as if he wants to memorize them, categorize them. fashion her into a special relic only he has he power to build with an unfamiliar set of tools. or a poorly timed flywheel he can coax back into sweetly singing rhythm.

he sets her aflame. makes her alive. settles an ache deep in her belly, a thrumming hollowness she can feel reflected in the way his breaths hitch and his fingers tremble at her kisses. she nibbles on the swell of his bottom lip and he groans, arms tightening to bring her flush to his lean form. 

his lips find the fluttering pulse beneath her ear. his words burn into her skin like a tattoo. "keep on doing that an' we won't make it to a bed, girl." 

she laughs and plants her own kisses along his scruffy jaw, rising up onto her toes to reach. "don't need one. i'm not used to doing this in a bed anyway."

he stares, veridian gaze hard enough to etch glass, a wyrmwind focused just on her. "ya' been done wrong. up ta me to fix it, of course."

suddenly he throws both arms around her, and secures her over his broad shoulder like a sack of concrete.

her yelp is lost amidst his deep chuckles as she squirms, cheeks flaming. "fel--"

"i never say no to a fix. or a challenge. ya can count on ol' fel."

his grip is impossible to evade. no amount of wriggling gets him to relax his hold on her even one bit. if anything, it seems to embolden him as she discovers when he palms the plumpness of her backside, and finishes with a little *smack*.

the heat inside her intensifies. the ache, the hollow yearning thrown further open. all protests vanish, leaving her tense, choking on a strangled moan.

"yea. ol' fel can be a real gentlemute. gonna treat ya ta something special."

and she knows he is absolutely not lying. not one bit. the moan tumbles the rest of the way out of her, unbidden, but she's well past embarrassment at this point. all that remains is anticipation.

#### *felix* --
he could've done without smacking his head in winnie's doorway, but felix wasn't one to bother with things like *embarrassment* when pretty women had their mouth on his neck.

especially not this pretty woman.

now that he'd laid her on his bed, her cheeks pink and her lips swollen with his kisses, he can't hardly think about anything that *isn't* how pretty violet is.

how much he wants to ruin her for anyone else. how he'd love to taste her pussy everyday for the rest of his life. fuck even the idea that he's about to discover what her pussy tastes like is about enough to make him cum his pants as if he's a damn teenager again.

with him standing in winnie's aisle, just behind her driver's seat he's in the perfect position to just tilt his head a bit and then *feast*. 

but he said he'd be a gentlemute, so he's gonna ask. "can i kiss you, vi?"

she reaches for him, eyes bright, but he shakes his head. "not ya mouth, not right now anyway." he grins and ghosts his fingers up the insides of her thighs. "i wanna kiss all this first."

the full body shiver she gives at his words shouldn't be so gratifying, but it absolutely is, and to pile sin on top of sin he has no interest whatsoever in repenting the bright flare of lust, pride, and possession that skitters through him, tingling from the tips of his ears to the soles of his feet. he keeps watching her as he toes out of his heavy boots and tosses the duster aside. his bracers and harness follow, as would his shirt, but she finds the buttons before he does. the top one near his throat open and replaced by her lips before he can collect himself enough to pin her by her wrists to the quilt, keeping her still with a knee between her thighs.

fuck is she ever warm.

beneath his palms, the suit begins to slide away, the pale gold of her skin appearing on her arms and throat.

he bends, placing a kiss at the hollow of her throat before whispering, "leave it on for a bit longer."

her high cheekbones and the bridge of her nose turn a becoming pink beneath the new freckles she's gained from the countless hours they've spent roaming the wastes together. she's not just pretty--but beautiful--and it takes his fucking breath away, his stupid leaping pulse ratcheting up even faster. how he hears her soft question of *why* through the roaring in his brain he'll never know. "i've heard it's fun that way," he grins, "plus i wanna unwrap ya real slow later, like a present." 

his sharp teeth graze over her suit covered breast and oh martyrs the *noise* she makes, all drawn out and helpless, breathy and moaning, her hips rolling in a slow mindless grind against his thigh. then she says his name like that too.

and he has no choice but to lose his fucking mind.

#### *violet* --
violet has been with men.

violet has been with women.

on one occasion violet was with a woman and a man while another man watched for a time, then joined in.

violet is the culmination of hundreds of years of research. an experiment in motion. a means to an end. her body; a vessel, a receptacle, a fragile collection of meat, bone, and nerve meant to house her inferior soul until it's eventual replacement by something better and more deserving. as such, she was not one to fuss about the mundane: clothing, or privacy, or personal boundaries. 

it is only a body. it is temporary. it is a privilege, and one easily rescinded at that.

but then felix led her out of eden. with gentle eyes and smirking fangs he tempted her with knowledge. lured her with care and attention.

and she took all he offered greedily, with both hands.

violet is no innocent, but she has never experienced the soft touch of breath upon her spread thighs, with or without the suit. it's intoxicating.

he drags her down, noses her cleft apart, and closes his lips over *something* that sets her ablaze inside and out. she jerks in surprise, hips grinding harder against the beautiful pressure of his mouth, and he responds by locking his arms around her thighs and filling his palms with breasts and ass, tilting her pelvis *just so*. everything throbs, everything burns, she exists only as a heartbeat and an endless spiraling ember directly beneath his kiss.

her fingers are tangling in his hair, then dancing beneath the open collar of his shirt, down his back to skate along lean muscle and puckered scarring. it's less a conscious act and more of a desperate hunt for an anchor against the rising tide within her but felix seems to enjoy it nonetheless. he growls possessively into the heat of her cunt, mouthing her through her suit as if he's starving and she's a banquet.

she draws tight and tense, as if in anticipation, though for what she knows not. she trembles head to toes, as though afraid, but of what? in the end its the vibrations of his growl that shatter her, his throat and lips pressed tight to the very center of that pleasure she'd never known, never experienced. she unravels hard, warmth and release flooding over and through her, insides clenching down on nothing, crying out his name and already greedy for more of this heaven she'd been ignorant of.

his hands and lips are all over her, claiming every inch of flesh he's just brought to a screaming peak. "mine" he growls again.

she's hard at work on the buttons of his shirt, her suit shrinking away to nothingness. she needs to feel him, skin on skin, heat on heat, the scent and taste of him a permanent part of her being.

#### *felix* --
gentle tugs bring him back up onto the bed beside her and small gentle fingers push his shirt off his shoulders. he holds her close, she fits against him perfectly. as if they were forged by the gods as one being, which was then split into two. 

she traces softly over his chest and he shivers, but never takes his mouth from her skin. skin now delightfully bare beneath his own hands, the silk of her flesh rasping beneath ragged calluses as he races to claim what is now his by touch and taste. he pulls away as his thumbs circle the stiffened peaks of her breasts, a mouthwatering shade of caramel against the gold.

her fingers slide further, down the line of dark hair on his belly, searching. she fumbles with the fastenings of his trousers when he closes his lips on one nipple to lave it with his tongue. "felix," she whimpers, working hard enough at the buttons that he briefly wonders if she'll just pop them right off, but at that moment they give way. the heavy heat of him in her soft hands, the full length caressed and stroked and he's so fucking maddeningly close already.

"vi," he grunts in warning, distracting her by trailing lower with kisses and licks, starving for another taste, another touch. his tongue flickers over the thin skin of her hipbone, cements his intent his gentle teeth, then soothes with a soft kiss. her breathing turns ragged, shallow, and she arches up against his mouth, nails sliding over his scalp and sending tremors straight to his neglected, aching cock.

he flips them. settling her sweet thighs against his ears, pressing her cunt flush to his lips, he draws his long tongue shamelessly over all the hot wetness he finds at her core. over delicate folds, back and forth across her sensitive apex, dipping inside her before circling back around to that throbbing little clit and tracing mindless shapes. she trembles as though with fever, so wild he's forced to grip her hips hard enough to bruise. her taste, her scent, the broken moan she lets out when he captures the little bud and sucks on it, he decides he'd die happy if he could have this everyday of his life.

but somehow she eludes him, contorting out of his hold and taking a new position down between his legs.

#### *violet* --
it bothers her slightly to be worshipped, while that enticing cock just bobs there, neglected, out of reach, pearl of pre cum beading up at the tip then gliding down past delightful looking ridges and veins to nestle in the dark hair and tightly drawn sac at the base.

he makes her feel so good. if she can't make him feel good as well; if she can't taste that cock right at this moment, she might die.

she pulls away from the delights of his mouth, spots upon her hips aching at the loss of pressure from his strong fingers.

in a lustful haze, she runs her tongue along the path the pre cum took, bottom to top, sac to head, tickling the flesh where his foreskin has pulled back with the very tip of her tongue. dimly, she registers a mangled approximation of "sweets" finding its way out of his mouth, the gentle pet name causing a new rush of slick heat between her folds. 

he tastes amazing, hot salty musk, thick as cream, and delicious spreading across her taste buds, sparking a craving for more. starved, she takes the whole of him into her mouth and explores him with lips, tongue, and throat. by the time she has to release him, he's dissolved into a glorious mess--panting, trembling, one fist tightly wound in her braid, the other hand gentle at the base of her neck.

another lick from balls to head, thrilled when his sac tightens further at the brush of her breathing. she uses her hands this time marveling at how thick he is, how heavy, mesmerized by the rhythm of his ridges sliding beneath her palms. he says her name, over and over again, in varying volumes and in varying states of completion, as though he is reciting hymns to a goddess. his tail curls possessively around her thigh, creeping up to caress her hips and under her breasts. the brush at the end swipes over her nipple and she whines, the length of him deep in her throat, she catches his tail with one hand and traps it, pulling gently but firmly.

"oh--fuck! oh fu--" fel convulses hard, fingers and toes curling, hips jerking as his cock begins to pulse between her lips.

she pulls away, locking eyes with him, lower lip caught between her teeth and her hands steadily stroking him through the climax. his mouth hangs open as his hot jets of cum spatter across her chin and breasts. 

his breathing begins to slow, but his eyes never leave hers. she straddles his hips, pressing the still semi-hard curve of him against her bottom. curious, she gathers his cum on her fingers and puts it in her mouth without preamble.

the length of him *throbs* against her ass, his eyes almost rolling up in his head as he pulls air in through clenched fangs, "fuck, vi. the things you do to me girl--"

she cuts him off, moving backward, still cleaning his spend off her body with one hand while the other lines him up with her hungry, soaked entrance and beginning to sink down.

#### *felix* --
