# UFO Town

There was next to nothing to see in the badlands.  They had left Winne behind at a place Felix called Cas Apach; when she asked what that meant he shrugged and pointed to the remains of a sign marking the entrance to the joint.  Most of the letters had fallen from it so that only “Cas” and “Apach” remained.

He said they would take the car from here, it would get them there much faster and navigate the streets of UFO town better than Winne would. And set about unhooking it from its trailer.

He wasn’t wrong about the speed, but she did miss the space she had in the motorhome.  The back of hatchback had its rear seats removed and replaces with various supplies, cobbled together devices, spare parts and weapons, including the overlarge  demon tooth spear.  This meant she was crammed into the front seat next to him, and worse that thing Roswell had found a spot in her lap.   It laid down and seemed to be sleeping, but she would occasionally see its third eye open to look at her as they traveled.  At one point she found herself absently stroking the creatures soft fur but stopped herself when she realized what she was doing.

The drive was very dull.  They were far enough away from Gluttony at this point that the sky was mostly blue with only a slight greenish tinge at its edges. Even Felix had run out of things to point out to her and as the drive carried on she found he could be silent… mostly.  He would still perk up when certain songs would begin to play over the cars speakers and he would sing off key along with them, often prefacing it with “Oh this is a good one!” and turning the volume up enough that the bass would rattle the vehicle and its contents.

After they passed a rusted green sign that had been spray painted over to read UFO town 10 miles. He turned down the radio and pulled to the side of the road.  Ahead she could see the beginnings of the buildings that made up the town.  A collection of old world ruins repurposed and rebuilt with ramshackle supplies.

Felix cut the engine.  He sat silent for several seconds the only sound being the occasional creak and tick of contracting metal bits as the engine cooled.  She was ready to ask him what they were waiting for when he turned to her.

“When we get into to town I’m goin’ ta need ya to do what I tell ya.  This ain’t a Mute town and It certainly ain’t no Corpo town.  The people here are… odd. An I wouldn’t be comin’ here if I didn’t need these bolts I’m owed.”

She wasn’t sure what he meant fully but bristled at the idea of taking more of his orders, and this obsession with ‘bolts’ was working her nerves.  “I thought we were going some place to get help with finding rose…” She folds her arms across her chest, her lips forming a defiant thin line.

“We are goin ta do that, I told ya we would, but after I get my bolts.  We will need em ta hire trackers a# titlend ta squeeze the info brokers.”

She was unconvinced. "I fail to see how these *bolts* you want will help us.  Surely any *tracker* or *info broker* would want corporate marks of credit for their service, and any true citizen should be honored to help me and my sister when the circumstances are explained.  Rose is the *prodigy* after all."

Felix's' tail twitches uncomfortably with annoyance against the car seat.  "I just told ya this ain't no corpo town.  Creds and scrip ain't hardly worth the paper they is printed on out in the waste.  Also people here are more likely ta think yer crazier than a black blood on a bender if ya start sayin yer lookin' fer the prodigy or are her sister. "

"Then why are we here?  We should be going to a proper franchise or better yet Zion itself!  If you take me there you will be rewarded I'm sure! " 

He grits his sharp teeth and speaks between them, "We been through this already buttercup they would kill me just fer havin' ya no matter what we tell em.  You didn't see how they were in that *garden* of yers they were killin' everyone that weren't already dead I'm not convinced they wouldn't have killed you too."

She narrows her eyes and her lower lip juts out the perfect image of petulance, "I don't agree. If I can explain to them..."

He cuts her off with a frustrated grunt, "I ain't takin' that chance! We need ta find Rose first.  If she really IS the *prodigy* then only her word can save us from yer people, so we are goin ta find her *My way* an my way needs cold hard nuts an bolts, and that,"  He points to rebuilt ruins ahead of them, "is where we get 'em."  He turns in his seat facing his body more towards her his face and voice softening, "An that place is dangerous, the people there ain't mine and they certainly aint yers, but its our best bet ta get what we need to find yer Rose."

She throws her head back purposely looking away from this infuriating creature beside her.  Roswell who had been watching the argument with some interest from her spot in Violet's lap tilts her head in Felix's direction two of her large red eyes remain fixed on him while the third keeps close watch on the underside of Violet's chin.

"Look Vi yer a *eel outta the aquifier* here, I just need ya to do what I tell ya so we can get this done then go about findin' yer sister."

She stares out the window for a long moment before her shoulders relax slightly and she turns back to him.  "Fine. But once this is done we waste no more time. We go strait to these *trackers* of yours, every moment wasted is another my sister is in danger."

He sighs with a measure of relief.  "Deal, but I need ya to promise me you will listen ta me in here."

Her eyes narrow again dangerously she senses a trick but sees no other option with out wasting more time arguing.  She won't blindly follow his orders no matter what she swears or promises, but if it will get them moving towards rose she will placate him.  For now.  So, she crosses the fingers of her left hand hidden beneath her folded arms before saying, "I promise."

Lanky towns have never quite sat right with Felix.  The whole vibe was always just slightly... strange.  UFO town was no different.  As the car pulled off the highway and started to coast between the repurposed buildings there were no organized check points like you might find in a corpo town and no mute sherriff signaling you to pull over so he can introduce himself and tell you the way of things, but rather you were greeted with closed doors and flipped signs.  The slower folk you might catch a glimpse of as they lowered the blinds or silently beckoned in their playing children off the street, but you were more likely to see the mechanical gaze of cameras that followed your progress as you passed. 

The people that lived here could almost pass as run of the mill human, but their limbs were just a little too long or their skin a little to grey.  Their eyes slightly too large and their nose too small.  The effect made their heads seem too large even when they weren't.  The more glimpse you caught of the retreating populous the more obvious it was that these people were only mostly human.  What the other part was Felix didn't quite know.  Mutes were obviously not fully human with their animalistic features; feathers, fur, claws and scales were honest in their anti-humanity. Lanky folk were sometimes uncanny valley writ large. 

"I thought you said this wasn't a mutant town?" Violet asked as her eyes followed the progress of a child with a reverse set of thumbs on their hands being ushered inside by their mother.

"It ain't... they aint mutes."

Felix turned the car down a side street, hoping he could remember how to get to the rendezvous.  The last thing he wanted to do was to get lost in a Lanky town. 

"They don't look like normal humans though... wouldn't that make them mutants?"

He stopped himself from laughing at the thought of anything in the world being *normal* and settled for a toothy grin in her direction.  

"Yeah they ain't human either... My boy Cid says they are called Annuks... or Ankai or somethin' like that. Most of us call 'em the Lanky folk."

She purses her lips and taps a slender finger to them unsure of what to think of this.  They must be mutants if they aren't human.  What else could they be?  She opens her mouth to object then stops as Felix pulls the car over next to a row of squat derelict buildings.  The street ahead ends in a T intersection and the facade on the building there reads "UFO Museum" or it used to.  the e and one of the m's has gone missing so it is now the "UFO Mus u ".

He turns and looks at her with a serious expression.  

"OK this is the place. Put yer cloak on and keep the hood up"

Annoying.  Unnecessary.  But easy enough to do really.  she debates arguing it anyways but decides its best to let him think she is still being a *good girl* and obeying his commands.  

She begins pulling on the cloak and tying it in place as he turns and starts rummaging through the piles of assorted junk in the back seat.   He tosses things aside and ends up having to lean further in to really reach down into floor beneath the rear seats to find whatever it is he is seeking.

"Imagine," she says as she ties the clasps of her cloak off while pulling up and adjusting its hood into place, "organizing things in any sort of way that makes sense."

He mumbles to himself as he continues his hunt and eventually finds what he is looking for and exclaims as such, and in his hurry to return upright with his prize ends up knocking his head against the butt of the overlarge spear that had been haphazardly tossed about in the search.  He holds his price in one hand and rubs the back of his head in the other as he glares at the offending weapon.  Its a small cylindrical object wrapped in a length of cloth, concealing its true identity from her.  

"What's that?" she asks looking at the mystery package.

"Huh?" he says remembering her suddenly.  "Oh its the payload."  He quickly tucks it into an interior pocked of his duster.

"The.. Payload?"  she raises a hooded eyebrow. 

"yeah its what they hired me ta bring em'."  He replies as though that answers her question, and before she raise it again he is examining her and reaches to make a minute adjustment to her hood. She reflexively pulls back and bats at his hand with annoyance. "Good he says. keep that up and I need ya to wait here in the car I wont be long."

Her eyes widen then narrow dangerously; her lips form a thin unamused line and the subtle way her jaw shifts suggest the grinding of teeth beneath them. He braces himself the impact as the tide of her defiance begins to swell and threaten to break over the levies of reason.  He leans back and throws up his hands in a placating gesture. 

"I won't be long and I need ya ta stay here these people are dangerous Vi."

"No." her reply is several octaves lower and many decibels quieter than he was expecting, but the stubborn defiance and finality is there none the less,  "I'll wear your stupid cloak, but I refuse to be left behind while you blunder about and waste time."  She unclicks her seatbelt then folds her arms across her chest staring at him with a resolute finality.

He takes a moment and chokes back his own frustration and exhales a long breath struggling to hold onto calm reason hoping against odds it can win out in the end.  

"Vi..." he stretches out her name as though it might reach her better if he spoke slowly and deliberately.. he locks his mismatched eyes with her own the pleading, borderline desperate appeal writ large on his features, "Vi you promised you'd listen and I mean it when I say its not safe.  I need ya ta stay here." 

His seemingly sincere plea catches her off guard, she too had braced for another fight, but this look of his, so at odds with usual smarmy self, gave her a moments pause, and in that sweetest of moments he thought he had reached her maybe, he had won out and she would listen, but it quickly passed and she turned her head away from him with a huff.

"I promised I'd *listen*, not that I'd follow all your orders. And I *will not* sit around waiting for you to solve all my problems like some helpless maiden."  She tilts her head back imperiously pointing her nose towards the heavens her hood falling back with the motion.  "I can handle my self better than you ever could, so not taking me with you to meet these *dangerous people* is putting an unnecessary risk upon your self *mutant*, not *me*.  And I refuse to let you compromise *my* chances to find Rose."

He makes a frustrated noise through gritted sharp teeth then and thinks how much easier it would have been had he just left her in that god forsaken bunker.

"You don't know what yer talkin' about Vi, these guys ain't like yer normal.."

She moves suddenly and with a quickness neither he nor the lazing Roswell in her lap expected. She lunged forward one knee resting on the console between them and positioned her face inches from his own cutting him off with a hissed "No!" 

Roswell, ejected from her perch suddenly, retreated into the cavern of junk in the backseat of the car.  Three lamplight eyes could be seen reflecting out from it's recesses. 

Violet narrowed her eyes to lock Felix's in place, "If I hear one more time that I don't know what I'm talking about I will show you how dangerous *I* am."  

He reads the challenge in her eyes and he knows this argument is lost to him. With her face so close to his he can smell the sweetness on her breath from the extra honey she added to her morning's oatcakes.  Her cheeks flushed pink with heat and anger and her lips, though drawn in a defiant line were oh so close to his own. He could hear the accelerated rhythm of her pulse as her adrenaline surged.  He'd be lying to himself if he didn't find this all more than a little enticing.  

He wondered briefly how she would react if he kissed her then, would she fall into it like they do in the old John Hughes films of another era? Her clenched fists giving way to fumbling hands and hastily discarded clothing? Probably not.  Unfortunate really.  Oh well.  Time for plan B.

He allowed his customary smirk to draw upon his lips then, and his eyes sparkled as he lean back far enough so that his head bumped against the car's window holding both hands out palms up so she can read his retreating expression.  

"All right buttercup.  You win." he says attempting to inject as much frustrating charm as he is able. "You can come with."  

She doesn't trust it at first, not one bit, but she does lean back into her seat again her posture untensing slightly.   

"But these lanky boys got a way of unsettlin' folk."  He unbuckles his own seatbelt.  "Some people lose time talkin' to em.  Cid says it's somethin' ta do with psychic somethin' er other... mind fuckery."  He waggles a finger in a circle next to his head while crossing his eyes.  

She looks at him with an incredulous expression.  "You won't scare me into not going."

"Scare ya nothin';  preparin' ya.  Try ta keep yer head strait.  Cid told me it helps him ta do math or number magic or somethin' in his head while talkin to em."

"You keep mentioning this Cid like its someone I should know."

"Oh yeah.  Cid's a brother of Gnosis, so 'es real smart.  Shitty at Street Fighter two though.  But he will kick yer ass at pong... which is a boring game anyways." 

She stares at him blankly, "That doesn't really explain... ya know what it doesn't matter. Does doing math in your head work for you?" 

He laughs suddenly but forces himself to stop when her eyes narrow again as she feels he may be mocking her, and he just grins at her instead, "Na girl, I don't do math in my head or anywhere else unless I want a head ache."

"Then how do you fight the... *Mind fuckery?*"

He shrugs, "It just don't work well on me really.  I feel when they do it, things get a little buzzy like I had a nip or two of booze, but nothin' more than that.  Cid says it's either cuz of my mutation or cuz I'm too dumb to be affected by it." He grins pointedly at her and taps the side of his head. "Could be either if I'm bein' honest."

She rolls her eyes and quickly turns away from him hoping he didn't notice the smallest of smiles that had come unbidden across her lips in response to his latest grin.  He clocked it of course, but didn't mention it for her sake.     

"Anything else?" she asked.

"Yeah.  Just be ready. If shit starts ta look rusty follow my lead.  And just ta be safe I'd start doin that math in yer head now."

She nods.  Her earlier defiance and anger replaced with determination.  He can see her focus on him, but the slight furrow in her brow tells him she is following his advice and probably thinking of whatever kind of math they taught her in that bunker she grew up in.  

"Aight," he says, "let me get yer door it sticks."  With out waiting he leaned over her purposely passing close by her, his neck just inches from her so she can smell his scent that reminded her of all the wild things that frequented the fairy tales she was fond of as a child.  

She could feel the heavy muscles of his form press against her for a mere moment.  She hadn't expected the sudden proximity and the surge of electricity that course through her her body at the sudden touch caught her breath for a moment, but then she sensed an opportunity and took it, a deft hand and slender fingers removing something from an inner coat pocket  to squirrel it away under her cloak.  A small victory and internal celebration that is just as quickly shattered and ruined when she hears the sudden clicking sounds and feels the cold steel close against her other wrist.

Her head snaps down to see the cuff and chain securing her right arm to the car door interior hand hold.  She grasps the cuffed wrist with her free hand tests the chain, which holds fast against the car door.  She tugs at it several more times understanding turning to rage as she hears the drivers side door open and feels the shifting as Felix steps out of the vehicle.  She turns too late and tries to grasp at him her claws only finding empty air as her new tether prevents her reaching his retreating leg as he steps out of the car.

She seethes looking at her chained arm then back at him as he leans down to look back in at her from outside the car door.

"Sorry Vi.  It's too dangerous I can't let them know about ya."

She stairs mouth agape  unable to respond right away and then she starts to scream with frustration and rage, and he quickly shuts the car door on her to muffle her outside the vehicle, which shakes as she tugs and pulls at the cuffed arm.

The UFO museum was a boxy unassuming building for the most part, its most distinguishing feature being the faded blue sign labeling it and what remained of the eponymous UFO flying saucer model that had degraded to little more than an odd circular frame.  Like most of the other buildings in downtown UFO town the place looked abandoned.  Several of its windows were boarded over and it was impossible to see past the gloom inside those that weren't.

As Felix approached the buildings front doors he found them to be chained shut. He stood there for a moment and scratched the back of his head.

"Shit" he muttered.

Had he gotten the wrong place. No this is where they said to go.  He glanced back down the road and saw the car had stopped shaking, so Violet must have calmed some, but the last thing we wanted to do was get back in the car and have to tell her he had the wrong address or some shit.  He grabbed the door handles and with a quick rattling shake he found the doors to be locked in addition to very securely chained.

He leaned in then wiped a layer of grime from the glass door and attempted to peer past the gloom inside.  He could make out the vague forms of an empty reception area with ticket counters and gift stands and make out some rotting t-shirts with cartoonish big headed grey men on them, but no signs of movement or anything.

He swore again and decided to knock.  Nothing happened.  He considered taking a chunk of the nearby crumbling asphalt and smashing his way in, but decided that if the lanky's were in there they might consider that an attack.  Maybe he was supposed to go the back door.  They could have told him that. He wasn't lying when he told Violet that talking to them could be disorienting, and even though it didn't seem to affect him as bad as others it did still muddy the sewage. 

He looked back once more towards the car.  The sun was starting to level with and dip below the tops of the buildings and it would be dusk soon.  He wanted to be out of here before dark.

He moved away from the door then intending to follow around the sides of the buildings to its rear when there was a blinding flash of white light from inside.  His eyes squinted to slits and he reflexively threw an arm up against the flash.  He heard the chains on the door unwind themselves and caught a faint whiff of what smelled like burning paper followed by something sickly sweet like a piece of fruit on the edge of rotting. The blinding flash faded slowly and he heard the old doors scrape open then close again before he could properly see. 

Felix blinked several times waiting for the white after image of the sudden flash to fade and he felt their presence before he could clearly see them, the back of his head already starting to buzz and ache.  There were two of them standing before the door, which was chained shut again behind them.  

They were both tall with skin so pale it was almost as white as the light they seemingly emerged from.  They wore crisp black suits cleaned and pressed, completely incongruous with the dirty and broken down environment.  They were nearly identical in appearance; with eyes slightly too big; a nose nearly too small; and their lips were little more than thin lines. To say they were bald was an understatement.  In addition to have no hair on their heads of faces they also had no eyebrows or even eyelashes.  Their limbs, in contrast to their facial features were all just slightly too long.

Only a few things set them apart from one another. One had noticeably bigger ears, which were still too small, while the others ears were so small that they were almost just holes on the side of their head. Their eyes also varied.  One had watery blue eyes that seemed pale against their dark sclera, and others eyes were a darker color over all a rich amber color.  They also each word different black hats.  Blue eyes sported a fedora atop his bald head and the other a bowler style cap.

Fedora spoke first. His voice was deadpan and serious, but there was somethin behind it that almost made it seem as though the air rippled.

"You are the thief. The one called Felix."

Before Felix could respond bowler added in his own buzzing monotone, "I am Mr. Fish and this one is Mr. Athens.  Did you see inside the Garden? Did you go beneath the dirt?"

Mr. Athens nodded, "You are late. You took longer than expected."

Felix blinked again and shook his head in an attempt to clear the sudden wobbly feeling He looked at Athens.  "Yeah, the whole thing was rusty from the start.  Everyone in that place was dead... till Corsec showed up that is..." 

Mr. Fish and Mr. Athens both tilted their head simultaneously as they took in his words.  The buzzing in his brain intensified for a moment and Felix choked on his words for a for a moment before he forced out, "It slowed everything down is all."

Mr. Fish spoke first this time, "Did the death unsettle you? How deep did you dig?"

Mr. Athens followed instantly with, "You retrieved the Spine. You completed your part. They weren't all dead."

Mr. Fish, "Why did you say they were all dead? Do lies bring you comfort?"

A bead of sweat rolls into Felix's eye and he wipes it away, taking the opportunity to rub the sides of his temples as well.  Of course they knew about Violet.  Idiot he thinks someone in the town must be reporting to them.  He should have left her in Winnie.  

"The details don't matter.  I got yer *Spine*.  I just want my bolts and you lot will never have ta see my again."

Mr. Athens, "The details matter. We have questions for you both."

Mr. Fish, "Would the bolts set you at ease? Would they help you speak the truth? What else was in the Garden?"

Mr. Athens, "The details are important. We will retrieve the Spine from your vehicle."

"No, no you don't need ta do that I got it right here."  He pats the interior pocket where he had placed the strange device he was hired to procure for them, and found it flat and empty. "wait.."  He pulls open the coat and sticks his hand in the pocket.  Empty.  He desperately checks his other pockets turning them inside out one by one, dropping nothing but lint and ceramic bullet casings in the process.  "shit.. its right here."  He cranes his neck rechecking his pockets.. "fuck."

An intense pain the back of his mind and a sudden dizziness causes him to stagger and lose all focus on his frantic search, he looks back up at the lanky boys, their expressionless stairs boring into him.  Mr. Athen's lips move but sound comes from his partner. 

Mr. Fish, "Does the truth frighten you?"

 Felix's brain continues to skip like a scratched record as Mr. Fish's mouth now moves but he hears Mr. Athens, "We are retrieving the Spine and the survivor now.  We are not fools."
 
 "Fuck." He mutters again.  He starts to turn back towards the car.  The stench of overripe fruit intensifies then and his head explodes with throbbing waves of pain causing him to stumble and lose his footing. His ears fill with a prolonged ring as his knees hit the dirty concrete he catches a glimpse of the shadowed forms surrounding the car before things go suddenly black.

 Violet's wrist had started to bleed from her pulling and thrashing at the cuffs.  This finally caused the suit to react.  It covered her exposed flesh protecting it from the *plasteel* loop binding it while also numbing and sewing the wound shut.  If she had full control she could have escaped this frustrating vehicle in a number of ways.  The suit could easily swell around her wrist expanding until the cuff broke, or form into miniscule tendrils and manipulate the tumblers inside the locking mechanism.  Picking locks has been one of Rose's favorite past times in the Garden, and when they discovered the suit could be used to do it easier than grown finger nails or hair pins could there was nary a lock that could prevent them access.
 
 The numbing sensation in her wrist calmed her momentarily, and she stopped her thrashing and she tried to slow her breathing.  She tried once again to will the suit to expand around her injured wrist or form into a protective bone covering, but it failed to heed her.  The skin suit would only act as the Spine saw fit, no neural commands or reasonings would influence it locked down as it was. 

She screamed then in frustration and thrashed against her cuffs again with renewed vigor.  The fit was short lived this time, and because her wrist and most of her left hand was now covered by the suit, it not longer even hurt her to struggle, which made the whole thing feel even more pointless.

Stop.  She focuses on slowing her breath and closes her eyes remembering the calming techniques Dr. Elliston insisted she practice.  She counted down from ten slow, each number a breath.  By the time she reached one her breathing was slow and steady.  She opened her eyes determined.  She remembered the package she stole from Felix and pulled it from beneath her cloak. It was fist size bundle wrapped in a well used grease towel.  It had some heft to it and she could feel sharp edges trying to poke out beneath the fabric.

Unwrapping it nearly threw her into another rageful fit of thrashing.  He was a fucking rat and a thief.  He had a stolen a Spine.  It was offline and wrapped neatly into a ball looking like a curled pill bug made of gold and plasteel.  She could see the small glass windows at each section filled with the black skin that would form the suit once the Spine was grafted to it's host.  

This was the proprietary technology of The Holy Empire of Zion.  A prototype lovingly crafted and developed for the patrons and employees of Zion and those who could one day hope to afford it's luxury, and he had pilfered it.  He wanted to trade it, probably to some rival corporation's spies no less, for something as banal as *bolts*?  Not even credits or scrip?  He was also an idiot.  And he would pay for his transgressions when she was free.

Free.  She looked down at the cuffs again, testing them once more and hissing like a feral cat.  She didn't lose herself again though and instead took stock.

She had three small seeds safely held in a hidden pocket at the base of her neck in the suit.  If she Withered all three she could gain enough strength to break the cuffs, but then she would have no reserves.  This is a last resort.  There must be something in this car she could use...

A subtle shifting sound and movement caught her attention she looked back and saw that the not cat thing... Roswell he had called it had relocated itself to atop a pile of old blankets and junk behind the driver's seat.  It had lifted one of his six hind legs high and strait behind its head and was cleaning itself. 

This was her answer.  If she could reach the not-cat she could Wither it and and escape and probably still have plenty of strength leftover for when she confronted Felix and the rival corporate spies he was meeting.  She would probably kill the creature in the process, a thought that gave her a slight pause, but not a big enough one to sway her path.  

She reached for the not-cat suddenly thinking speed and surprise her ally in this instant.  Her bonds saw that it wasn't she snapped to the end of her tether her finger tips barely grazing the soft fur of one leg and her right arm banging and grazing against the junk between herself and the creature.  Something clattered to the floor dislodged and a few other suddenly loose objects follow it with a tumbling glee.  The ecosystem of this rear seat was fragile and prone to shifting.  

For its part Roswell barely reacted to the sudden movement, deeming it necessary to only turn one pair of ears towards Violet as it continued to clean it's nether regions.  The rhythmic lapping of tongue against fur returning once the junk resettled.  Violet stretched her fingers pulling against the bonds hard. She could feel the suit react in protest by thickening slightly around her wrist to prevent the cuff biting in again and undoing its hard work.  The tips of her fingers felt fur again.  The not-cat was tantalizingly close, but she couldn't quite touch it's flesh, which she needed to do in order to attempt to Wither it. The light brushing of fur must of have annoyed the creature because it paused its cleaning to shift back a millimeter putting even its black fur out of reach.  It resumed cleaning it self, moving on to one of its middle leg haunches.  Three ears now pointed in Violet's direction.

She grunted with frustration and leaned back into her seat.  If speed and surprise failed her she would have to try subterfuge.  This was always Rose's forte, but how difficult could it be to trick a dumb beast such as this?  She sat forward and took a deep breath putting on the sweetest of looks she could muster.  She held her right hand out then palm up in a supplicating gesture.  

"Roswell, come please."  she rubbed her fingers together then and did her best to recreate the *pss pss* noise she had heard Felix would make before feeding her.  

A small smile of triumph crossed her face when the not-cat paused its cleaning to lift its head in her direction.  Two of its three lamplight eyes, one yellow the other blue at the moment looked her in the eyes and slowly blinked.  The third eye atop its forehead remained closed for now.  

"Come on.  come see me." she maintained a sing-song voice as she spoke to the beast feeling her triumph at hand.

It blinked again, but didn't move.

She rubbed her thumb and fingers together again making the same *pss pss* noise.

"Come on you stupid thing" she sang her teeth gritting together with growing impatience now.

Roswell simply tilted its head and bleped out its tongue at her in a gesture she found quite foolish and would have ridiculed if she weren't so desperate.

"Come here you idiot... please come here," desperation and frustration filtered through her gritted teeth and inter her voice the sing song quality gone.  Roswell blinked again then tilted its head further so that it was disturbingly almost completely upside down.  It's too long tongue still hanging from its mouth flipped upside down as well revealing an underside repleat with small succors not unlike an octopus's tentacles

She cringed pulling back instinctively with a revolted grunt.  "What are you!  You are not a cat!" She exclaimed.

Subterfuge would obviously not work.  So instead she would use something to pull the creature closer to her.  She put her hand on the haft of the bone spear that laid across the back of the seat thinking she could either maneuver it close enough for her to grab or, skewer the damn thing and bring it before her like a cut of synthmeat steak on the end of a really long fork. 

Roswell's head swiveled suddenly back upright though and its third eye, the crimson one, shot open.   Had it somehow intuited her intent?  She noticed too then that an eye on the right forearm of he suit had opened as well, it was looking past her towards the pasenger side window behind her and she was suddenly flooded with warning.  The not-cat thing disappeared then, slinking somewhere into the junk piled in the back seat completely out of sight.

"no no no no no... Shit!" She swore then forgetting the warning eye and tried to shift some more of the junk aside hoping to spot black fur again.  

She muttered and cursed more shifting junk and half finished devices aside until there was a sharp knock at the window behind her.

She froze then, She felt an eye in the suit open at the back of her neck.  The stupid poncho that idiot mutant made her wear insured it was covered and thus blind to whoever was at the car's window.  The knock rang out again and she jumped and then sild back into her seat the taught chain of the cuffs relaxing as she turned to look out. 

A tall slender person had peered over to look through the window, their eyes just a little too wide and a little too black, greyish white only bleeding from the black at their very edges and corners.  They reflected funnily through the glass.  She, or at least Violet thought she looked mostly like a she, blinked and tilted her head.  She was bald but the dome of her pallid skull was covered by a black wide brimmed hat.  Her nose was to small and so upturned she could clearly see up the nostrils.  

Her thin pallid lips parted and violet heard, "This one introduces themself as  Ms. Smile."  

The lips then took on the vague approximation of a *smile* as though it was punctuating the thought.  It was really a formation lost somewhere between a grimace and a smile though and gesture never touched those black eyes.  Rather than reassure it sent a cold shiver down violet's back.  

"Who does this one have the pleasure of speaking with?"  As the words reached Violet she noticed the *smile* never left the lips of Ms. Smile. and despite speaking through a closed door and window the voice was clear and unmuffled as though Ms. Smile was speaking directly into her mind. A dull ring accompanied the words and Violet felt as though she was viewing things through a sudden fog.  She should answer Ms. Smile.  She wanted to but her tongue was suddenly thick and dry like she had stuffed her mouth full of cotton.  She tried to speak her name but mumbled thickly.

"Ms. Violet.  That is a pretty name.  You should come with me now."

The ringing intensified and she found herself fumbling with the door.  She dimly remembered talk of math and distractions but it slipped away.  She dumbly pulled at the door handle which did nothing.  She had to get the door open though she couldn't keep Ms. Smile waiting.  She tried pressing buttons unaware of the others now standing around the car.  A trickle of blood runs from each of her nostrils and both ears.

There is a sudden a jolt in her spine.  The suit sensing the intrusion finally reacted.  The fog cleared momentarily with the sudden pain and the black flesh covering her expanded wrapping her bare feet and hands and finally her entire head. After a moment boney protrusions formed a mask similar to that of a jack rabbit's skull over her face.  She stared out through the empty sockets her mind clearing and she is able to fully take in her surroundings.  There were three other figures around the car now, similar in look to Ms. Smile  They all wore back suits, were bald and wearing black hats of varying styles.

Ms. Smile continues to *smile*. "This one Ms. Violet wears the flesh.  Interesting."  Ms. Smile straitens then, no longer leaning to look into the window, and the others do the same.  The car windows and windshield begins vibrating and hums and then then all at once all the glass explodes inward shattering into a million shards.

Felix grasp at his consciousness like a toddler reaches for a favorite toy placed just out of reach.  The tips of his fingers brush against it causing swirls of color and intense pain to break up the lulling black.  In these moments his brain feels as though it is being crushed into a fine paste and extruded out through every hole in his head.  It would be easier to just accept the black.  That won't happen though.  He's too stubborn for it.  He can't remember exactly why he needs to be awake at the moment but once he does remember, he is sure he will be pissed about it. 

Colors dance again and the brain crushing feeling stars to slacken for a moment.  A long enough moment for his eyes to flutter open slightly his head is against the road, coppery blood from his nose, eyes, and ears mixing with gravel and dirt.  His awareness is still fuzzy and the eyes flutter closed again.  He needs to refocus.  He needs something to pull him the rest of the way. He finds he can work his jaw some now and so he does shifting it about against the road until he feels his teeth part enough to allow his tongue to slip between them.  He bites down then his razer sharp fangs easily puncturing and tearing through the fleshy tongue filling his mouth with pain and blood.  

Delightful physical pain, it snaps his senses back into place.  The fog lifts and  his shattered memories reform themselves. He remembers Vi and the trap laid by the lankys.  He was pissed.  

He he doesn't move yet though, he squints his eyes open enough in time to see the dress shoes of Mr. Athens or Mr. Fish lift from the pavement before him to step over his prone form.  The throbbing in his head has reduced to a dull ache.  They seem to think they've got him in hand and are probably now going to go help the others that were surrounding his car and violet.  He waits until he hears the crunch of their receding foot steps before he moves to stand.

He wipes the blood and dirt from his face smearing it more than cleaning anything then he loudly hawks and spits out a gob of blood.  

Mr. Fish noticed the sound and turned back around to face Felix.  He tilts his head and Felix hears the question pass through his tormented brain even though the tall man's lips never part.

"How are you still standing?"

His injured tongue is swollen throbbing in his mouth.  He is pretty sure he swallowed part of it, but Felix grins anyways revealing sharp bloodied teeth.

"Thaths' nuthphin, "  he stumbles over his injured tongue.  "ith'll thake more than fath ta puth down ole Thel."  

Mr. Athen turns around as well then. Felix can see past them to the others surrounding his car.  Three of them at least.  One of them seems to be looking in the front passenger side window.  Probably at Violet.  

"You're certainly a resilient sort.  More than we would have expected of a mutant thief.  We will have to study you."

"Fucth you" He spits again and starts forward.

The black clad men don't react, they simply stare at him as though he were little more than a petulant child.  He feel their attack on his mind renew, but he is ready for it this time.  As he continues to close the distance between himself and the two lanky boys he suddenly and violently slams his right fist against his own skull.  The men in black flinch and Felix stumbles forward his mind once again hazy, but this time more from his own self inflicted blow rather than their combined mental assault.  An attack which has once again abated either from their sudden confusion or his own self-inflicted pain didn't really matter.  

Felix stumbles and then staggers into Mr. Athens and the tall man is forced to grab and steady him to prevent them both from tumbling to the ground.  A quick and clever hand finds itself inside the man's jacket. A hand closing around a holstered side arm hidden beneath it.  He pull it out.  The small sleek pistol feels way too light and he worries the damn thing isn't loaded, but the dice are cast now and if they come up snake eyes there is no stopping it now.  

Before Athens can react or realize what is going on the nose of the gun is pressed beneath his chin.  "Sthuda justh given me my bolths" Felix pulls the trigger.  

He expected a deafening bang, and to be covered in Athen's blood, but instead there was a much more subtle thwhiping noise and the smell of burnt flesh and ozone.  A clean hole is burned through the front of Athen's face as a blasting bolt of emerald energy sails away into the sky.  The lanky then collapses at Felix's feet.

Mr. Fish, perhaps stunned by the sudden turn of events doesn't react as Felix turns the strange pistol towards him pulling the trigger three times in quick succession; green bolts lit the air between them burning three holes into the tall man's chest.  He falls down beside Mr. Athens not moving.

Felix then tilts the small pistol towards himself admiring its sleek curved design and shined metal whose surface seemed to shine with iridescence colors almost as he tilted it back and forth in the setting sun.  He also marveled at how impossibly light it was again.  He'd have thought it a child's toy if it hadn't just done what it did.  

"Well Shith"

The admiration of his new favorite side arm is interrupted when he hears all the glass on his car suddenly Shatter.

---
Shards of glass tinkle and crash into Violet.  The Skin protects her from any harm; sharp edges forming lines along her right arm and tearing fresh holes in to her cloak.  

Ms. Smile reaches inside and unlatches the door.  She attempts to pull it open but Violet simply pulls her bonds tight in the other direction forcing the cuff to snap the door shut.  She smells the over ripe fruit scent strongly now and is aware of the rear doors and the hatch of the car being pulled open.  

"This one is bound to the door.  Curious."  Her black eyes then spot the curled Spine unit resting in Violets lap.  "Ah the device.  The Spine."  She casually reaches through the window with the intent to simply pluck it up and away.  

Violet grits her teeth beneath her rabbit's mask and grabs the strange woman's wrist with her free left hand and pulls it up and away from the Spine.  "No."

Ms. Smile's thin lips turn downward and she leans into the car further and both women fail to notice the two green bolts that briefly light up the sky behind her.  She grabs Violet's hand with her free one and begins to pry at violet's fingers to release her grip.  Violet tries to join her right hand into the struggle but is quickly reminded of her tether as the cuff is once again pulled taught. 

She curses and struggles to twist and attempts to put her legs between herself and Ms. Smile, but that puts the Spine closer to her, so she releases her grasp on Violet's fingers and attempts to snatch it.  Violet responds by spreading her legs apart which causes the Spine to clatter down to the floor board beneath her.  Ms. Smile grunts in frustration turning her attention back to Violet who continues to hold her.  Rather try and pry herself loose again she holds her hand up palm open towards Violet's face.  She expects her to slap or punch her, but instead feels an invisible force begin to press against her forcing her head to turn and bend painfully backwards.  

Violet struggles against it with a defiant scream.  The telekinetic force increases but she refuses to let go of Ms. Smile's wrist.  She then lifts her right arm upwards as far she can so that it smacks into  the side of Ms. Smile.  Some of the glass shards imbedded into the skin are now stuck into Ms. Smile's side; blood that's more pink than red seeps out from the newly formed holes. 

Ms. Smile grunts with the sudden sharp pain and loses her focus for a moment the invisible force away long enough for Violet to thrust her head forward so that the bone of her skull's mask smacks into Ms. Smile's too small nose with a satisfying crunch of cartilage and a spray of more pink blood.

Ms. Smile grabs her broken nose with her free hand and screams an inhuman scream that sets Violet's ears ringing.  The world outside the car is filled with several flashes of white light and the air smells heavily of burning paper and hot metal.  Ms. Smile's hand shoots back towards Violet and the telekinetic force returns greater this time forcing Violet's head back and causing the whole car to vibrate wildly.  The pain in her neck is excruciating.  Violet feels her neck will snap if the pressure doesn't stop.  She has one last option.  The skin, which has covered her completely as a defense mechanism is resistant to Violet's mental urges to uncover her left hand.  She forces all her will into the spine urging it to comply.  It stubbornly refuses.  

It's programmed only to protect her right now, not follow her orders.  She lets out her own frustrated scream and tries a different approach.  She plants her feet against the car door and pushes against it pulling her cuff so tightly that it bites through the Skin and into her own pink flesh.  Sensing the new danger The Spine moves to thicken the Skin around that wrist, it finally acquiesces to Violet's request pulling skin back from the left hand to better protect her right wrist.  

The tips of Violet's fingers are uncovered.  Her bare skin touches the pallid skin of Ms. Smile.  Violet's neck bends back further threatening to snap.  She begins to wither Ms. Smile.

Power.  Strength floods into Violet as it leeches out of her attacker, the pressure against violet's face and neck abates slowly, and the rageful look on the Ankai's face falters and becomes one of concern as the arm Violet clutches begins to shrivel and shrink like a prune.  

"What is this one doing?"  She asks fear creeping into the edges of the voice.  "Stop... Stop!"  She begs as she drops the telekinetic force all together and instead desperately tries to pry at Violet's fingers again.  Touching Violet's bare fingers proves to be a mistake as that hand begins to shrivel and waste as well.  

Ms. Smile continues to futilely pull at violet's hand in a panic her attempts growing weaker and more feeble with every passing moment until she can barely hold her head up.  She looks the part of a frail old woman now a near desiccated corpse with the faintest flicker of life left in her.  She stops struggling and falls limp all fight gone.  Violet releases her hold on her then and Ms. Smile slips and falls like a sack of bones out the car window clattering to the ground.

Violet blooms the gathered strength into herself.  Yanking hard at her bound wrist easily snapping the plasteel chain as though it were made from paper. She plants both feet against the car door again and kicks it hard so that it flies off its hinges and crashes into the wall of the building next to it.  She stands up and out of the car, kicking what remained of Ms. Smile aside as though it were liter in her path.  She finds the car is now surrounded by a dozen or more tall men and women in black suits.

---

There are three of them around the car.  One starts to reach inside and tries to open the door, but the car shakes and the door snaps shut again. The stubborn girl is still awake and resisting them.  He finds a note of admiration at seeing her tenacity focused on someone other than himself for a change and grins.  He cast the warmth aside though knowing she will do better with his aid than with out it.  He curses himself for locking her to the door though, and finds the swear he speaks is no longer stuffed with cotton.  His tongue no longer swollen with pain.  

The healing is always fast for him, but it always takes its toll later, but this isn't later its now, and now he has to fix his fuck up.

He moves forward raising the pistol up.  The one at Vi's window leans inside and based on the way she moves is struggling with the girl.  The lanky by the rear passenger door unlocks it and throws it open looking as though he is moving to help the female one struggling with Violet.

Felix squeezes the trigger on the gun twice, thwip thwip! Two green bolts sail forward, one goes wide and the other smacks the lanky in their right shoulder pushing him back from the car door and causing him to stagger to its knees with a grunt.  That arm hangs limp and it holds its left hand over the wound.  

Felix notices for the first time that these Ankai or whatever they are called have an extra thumb one on each side of their hand.  Odd.  "An' I thought I was a freak." he mutters under his breath.

The injured lanky attempts to push the door open further with its good shoulder and tries to slide behind it for cover.  Felix fires another shot at it but misses as the creature scrambles out of the way loose gravel scrapping against its shoes  as it goes prone and starts to push itself under the car for even greater cover.

"'Ey! Get yer kung fu grip off my car ya baster..."

He is cut off by a sudden flurry of thwipping noises as the third lanky on the driver side begins firing a a barrage of its own green bolts in his direction.  Felix is forced to duck and dart half crouched for a nearby alley and he smells burning hair as a green bolt singes the tuft of fuzz at the end of one of his pointed ears. 

He flattens himself against  the wall, silver gun held up and ready.  He tries to peer around the corner and is met by another volley of green plasma and is forced to duck back as it burns scorching chucks out of the corner of the concrete wall.  Pinned.  Not good.  

He considers firing blindly in that direction to maybe force the lanky back or down, but quickly cast the notion aside fearing he might accidently hit Violet in the process.  

He looks down the alley way for a solution.  The alley ends in a solid brick wall, so no back way out.  The only thing of potential use is an ancient decaying dumpster.  It's more rust than steel at this point, but its all he has at hand. The sudden frustrated scream from Violet hastens his decision.

He moves to the dumpster.  One of the short walls of the thing looks to be somewhat intact as it was protected from the elements by the brick wall beside it.  He kicks at the rust bits around it till a chunk of it breaks free.  He is able to slide his arm through what was once a metal side loader and hoist the thing up like an impromptu shield.   

He sprints for the edge of the alley way holding the green steel between himself and the shooter.  The thwip of green bolts light up the air around him. A few thud into his makeshift shield. 

The Lanky shooter had begun to edge around the car at this point leaving him more exposed than he was in his previous position. Felix waits for the initial shots to stop then drops the green steel as he leaps into a diving roll, coming up in a crouched position directly facing the Lanky his cover now completely lost.  

Felix fires three quick shots at the shooter and lanky gets one more off in his direction as well.  That bolt scorches a hole through the left side of Felix's coat and shirt grazing his left flank leaving him scorched but not seriously injured.  The lanky on the other hand looks down to see three new burning holes in its chest.  The gun drops from lifeless fingers and it clatters to the ground.  The Lanky follows shortly after.

Felix stands and straightens with a wincing groan at the burning pain in his side.  He can't stop to examine it though as the lanky woman is still struggling with Violet in through the car window.  

As he starts the limp towards he raises the pistol towards the female lanky when there is a flash of white light behind him and the smell of burning paper fills the air.  Suddenly he feel as though a rope is lassoed around his ankles and they are yanked out from under him.  His head smacks into the pavement  and he loses his grip on the silver gun as his world goes fuzzy and is then flipped upside down as some invisible force is now dangling by his legs like a snared deer.  

His vision clears and he can sees an upside down lanky.  This one is wearing an over large black cowboy hat.  It is holding one hand out and up in the direction of Felix's legs as the other hand draws out its sidearm and starts to level it dangerously towards Felix. 

Felix tries to kick and wave his arms to no avail.  He is stuck. He spots the dropped silver pistol and reaches for it, clawing at the asphalt but the gun is well out of reach. 

The Cowboy takes its time leveling and aiming its weapon. Felix can tell the thing is concentrating on holding him up... somehow.  

"You fucks are magic now or somthin' too?"  The Lanky tilts its head seemingly bemused.  It's finger finds the trigger and starts to squeeze.

A sudden unnatural scream issues from the car.  It's the Ankai Violet is fighting off.  Felix dips suddenly crashing most of the way to the ground has his attackers concentration monetarily fumbles, Its attention drawn to the struggle in the car.   

The cowboy lanky recovers quickly though pulling Felix back up by his ankles again, but it wasn't quite quick enough.  When the lanky turns his full attention back to the telekinetically snared thief he is surprised to find the hunk of broken broken blacktop Felix managed to grasp when he hit the street flying straight into it's face. 

The cowboy's hat flies off as his head and is thrown back with a bloody crunch as the stone hits the thing's left eye.  Felix is released to the ground again and scrambles for the pistol.  

Clutching its injured face with one hand the cowboy fires wildly at the spot Felix scurries across the ground.  Green bolts sending chunks of black top flying.  

Fel grabs the gun and rolls onto his back sitting up quickly and fires back at the  cowboy.  He strikes the Ankai's leg and it crumples to the ground clutching at both its leg and head now the fight is out of this one.  

Felix stands and starts to move towards the car.  He raises the gun intent on shooting the half of the female sticking out of the vehicle.  When he pulls the trigger though nothing happens.  He pulls it again.  Nothing.  he holds up the weapon and looks at it.  other than a few scuffs from being dropped it seems fine  he smacks the side of it and shakes it.   He pull the trigger again pointed upward this time.  Still nothing.  

"Fuck."

He almost chucks the weapon aside but decides to pocket it inside his coat instead.  He'll have to deal with her the old fashioned way.  

He starts forward again but stops when he smells that burning paper again.  A white flash to his left in one of the nearby apartment buildings.  Then another to his right.  Then several more in quick succession all around him.  The smell of paper gives way to heated metal as the dark windows of each building nearby are rapidly illuminated by a myriad of flashes. 

After a moment the flashing stop.  The only sound is the struggling women in the car, and that too starts to quiet as the movements of the Ankai leaning in the window begin to slow.  Then the doors of several buildings all start to slam open and the street is filled with dozens of lankys.  They bear silver rifles and pistols most of which become trained instantly on Felix standing in the middle of the road.

"Rust."  he curses as he throws his hands up.

A circle starts to close in on him, and another group turns and moves to surround the car.  

"Don't suppose one 'o you guys 'ave my bolts eh?'"

They respond by hitting him with a nauseating wave of their mind fuckery.  He doubles over, which aggravates his burned side sending a fresh wave of pain up his torso.  The pain lets him shake the mind fucking just long enough for him to look up and see the butt of a silver rifle smack into his forehead.  There is flash of colors that dance across his vision before things go fuzzy and black once again.
  
---

It’s fuzzy at the edges and he’s pretty sure he taste bile on the edge of his tongue, but consciousness returns to Felix more quickly than expected.  Something has pulled the Lanky attention away from him, leaving him to his renewed pain and fresh puddle of sick and blood beside him.   

He places unsteady hands beneath himself and pushes them against the broken black top trying desperately to find his footing.  He is only able to push himself onto his knees at first.  His head lulls unsteadily and feels as though a nail has been driven through his temples.  He almost falls forward again but catches himself, one hand brushing against the smooth curve of the strange pistol he dropped before.  He wraps fingers around the grip holding it up as he blinks rapidly trying to steady his vision.  

Something warm and stinking of ammonia splashes against his face. He wipes at it dumbly with his free hand as he manages to stagger to his feet.  His vision clears and he isn’t sure what to make of the scene around him.

Lankys lay strewn about the ground looking as though they had been savaged by a beast or demon.  Their blood, which is more burgundy than red, has painted the street and buildings in spattered arcs.

A group of still standing lanky's are surrounding something by his car.  He watches as something arcs through the air and one of their heads rolls free from its body thudding to the ground.  The body crumples soon after and he can see it.

He thinks it is a demon at first. A Lithe dark form with a shining skull of a head.  Its hands end in six inch razor sharp talons.  It twists unaturally bending its limbs and frame in unexpected ways to dodge the green blots of energy being fired at it by the encroaching ankai.  It dips forward, suddenly extending its arms, stretching them impossibly  thin and driving those razor sharp claws through the torso of one of the lanky boys.  The creature drops dead guts falling out the newly made hole in its stomach.  

Felix recognizes the form and the strange rabbit’s skull mask then.  It’s Violet.  She spins then a dervish of claws and stretched limbs dropping two more lankys.

“What the fuck.”
