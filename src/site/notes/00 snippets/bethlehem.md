# bethlehem >> first crack at felix entering the experimental facility 

The plastisteel door slid shut and Felix knew he’d been had.

This didn’t make him angry, or even frightened. Felix wasn’t that kind of müte. He’d been around long enough to have a well deserved reputation for being one "slippery sonuvabitch," and he didn’t intend to break that winning streak now.

If anything he found himself amusingly befuddled, delighted at being presented with a bit of a challenge as opposed to the last few weeks interminable black market organ runs. Missions where he drives days upon days through wind and dust to deliver the goods on time and get paid just enough to cover fuel.

If that.

This was the big job that would turn it all around. An easy drive, a little smash and grab, and a drop. He could do it in his sleep. The pay was a number he’d never heard spoken out loud and certainly couldn’t comprehend.

Or clourse it was too good to be true.

His eyes adjust after a moment, the gold green slits fine tuning themselves to allow just the right mix of light and darkness to strike his corneas and no more. A hallway stretches before him, no doors, just the sort of flouro lamps that you can *hear*buzzing even when the damn things are off.

But he hears nothing. The facility is silent and stale, feeling somehow ancient though he knew for a fact it didn’t exist some thirty odd years back. 

An authoritative silence, like that of a church or a tomb, one that causes all souls within to maintain quiet or expect swift retribution.

A crunch echoes from the floor. Vines of every thickness cover the floors and walls, once vibrant green perhaps but now dead and crumbling away to dust. The same drab hospital color as everything else, which is why he didn’t see it.

His tomblike corridor thrums with whispers for a moment, which prickles the fine hairs on his neck and tail and which he strategically ignores in favor of what his ma would call "getting the fucking lead out."

A full hour passes and Felix has had more than his fair share of the weird ash flowers, the whispering, and the fucking infinite corridor when it opens out. He squints against the blazing lights to make out a huge room of steel and glass and expensive looking panels purpose built for whatever the fuck—he has no idea.

That’s not important.

The important bit is the corpses.

Likely his supplier is someone amongst the tawdry, besplattered heap, incongrously webbed over with yet more of the vines and flowers. Though it’s possible that is her dismembered leg over there dangling from a flouro fixture. That bit of hand and wrist. Maybe the rent and broken torso just… Sitting at a desk. Doing torso things. Or even that particular slimy mound of blood and shit smeared intestines had been cozied up where it was supposed to be just moments ago?

Inside her belly.

Not that he knew a gender, really.

Or anything much.

The more he thinks on it the more surprised he is those lanky fucks ever got the wool over his eyes.

At least he’s breached the inner sanctum. It’s a start. Fuck, more than a start, by his math this job is more than half done, all that’s left is to find the drop, secure the stuff, then hit the exit. One step out of four checked off. Easy.
