# Rough Timeline
*[[00 snippets/in the beginning\|in the beginning]]*
## Ancient Times and [[04 groups/the eldest ones\|Old Gods]]

- ???? - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] and [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|The Fleshwarper]] begin their eternal war
- ???? - [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Maw of Chaos]] joins the war.
- ???? - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] strikes a killing blow against [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Fleshwarper]] scattering its remains throughout the cosmos.
	- [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Maw of Chaos]] is caught in the attack and sundered into two halves.  
- ???? - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] begins its long slumber in the depths of far space to recover and prepare for [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Fleshwarper]]’s inevitable return.
- ~3.7 billion years ago (BYA) - A part of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] impacts with earth. It is a skull fragment featuring a myriad of eye sockets.
	- Life starts to appear shortly after this. A forest eventually forms around the skull fragment.  Most fauna instinctively avoided the skull.
- ~2.6 BYA - [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the infinite pattern]] briefly rouses to establish watch points throughout the universes near locations parts of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] has landed. His followers are to keep vigil as it returns to its slumber.
	- The Hexagon on Saturn forms, which serves as [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the Pattern]]’s watch point in our star system.
	- The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] of the Pattern come through the Hexagon and establish colonies on Titan, Callisto, Mars, and Venus.  They also establish a military style observation point inside earths moon after hollowing it out.
- ~68 million years ago (MYA)- A Carchatodontosaurs in the late Cretaceous period was chasing prey through a dense rainforest when the large theropod stepped on a shard of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]’s skull bone.  A fragment became lodged int he creatures foot which grew infected. By the time it died most of its skin had turned black and it had grown several extra eyes.  Scavengers ate the corpse of the theropod and they too became infected with [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the flesh]].  It begins to slowly spread throughout the dinosaurs in the region like a cancer.
	- The cancerous Flesh begins spreading beyond the jungle of its origin and [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]] experiences a glimmer of awareness.  
	- The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] soon notice the anomalies and launch an asteroid at the Earth causing the extinction of the dinosaurs and returning [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]] full to death.
	- [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the fallen flesh]]’s skull fragment is displaced by the impact and ends up in a deep oceanic trench that would one day be part of the Gulf of Mexico
- ~2.8 MYA - One half of the Sundered Chaos, who will eventually become known as [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Diminished One]] reaches earth.
	- The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes]] mark [[03 people/The Diminished One\|The Diminished One]]’s arrival, but their directive is related to that of [[03 people/the fallen flesh\|the Flesh]] and so they only observe it and do not interfere or disturb [[03 people/the infinite pattern\|the pattern]] about it.
	- The Homo Habilis makes its first appearance around this time.
## The Rise of Man

- ~12,000 BCE The Natufian culture becomes the first semi-sedentary culture of man.  
	- The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes of the Pattern]] take Notice of this development, and determine that humanity will eventually become the dominate species of the planet and begin to focus their gaze upon them.
- ~4000 BCE the Sumerians are visited by the [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Acolytes of the Pattern]], The Sumerians refer to them as the Anunnaki, or beings from the sky.  The [[04 groups/acolytes of the infinite pattern\|Anunnaki]]
	- The Anunnaki do their best to influence and study early human civilization which they recognize as not only creatures spawned of Flesh, but also influenced by the Diminished One.
- 

## The Revelation
- 9/9/1991 The CEO consumes the last intact eye of the Fallen Flesh in an [[06 concepts/apotheosis\|apotheosis]] ritual.  
	- The ritual is imperfect  Flesh begins to grow and multiply and shoot off of the CEO, spreading patches of it around the Western United States, these patches will eventually become the [[05 places/the demonwastes\|Demonfields]] as Flora and Fauna in these areas begin to undergo transformations of the Flesh.
	- The CEO's form begins to fleshwarp wildly as well, as the Fallen Flesh takes root, a human body is an unsuitable vessel for the Fleshwarper.  The CEO feels himself beginning to unravel.
	- The CEO, in a desperate bid to hold on to divinity is forced to use nearly 99% of his power to hold himself together and manages to somewhat stabilize his form and halt the uncontrolled flesh warping. 
- The Anunnaki, recognizing the Fallen Flesh is reawakening before their lord is able to return fall back on a contingency plan it is one meant to delay more than anything.  They drop several nuclear bombs on the Gulf of Mexico and several Key Cities in the Mid Western United States, including Austin.
	- This triggers mass confusion and the launching of reactionary nukes by the US at several nations, who in turn launch their own triggering a global nuclear war. 
- The meat dome closes over the city of Austin, TX
	- The CEO seeing the attacks launched does this to save himself and his assets from the nukes.  It also affords him to opportunity to go into a hibernation period while he learns to better control his new abilities. 
	- While he slumbers his form spreads into the earth beneath Austin and tendrils begin branching out.  
	- The people of Austin being worshiping the CEO for saving them and as the sole source of the Flesh now, new technologies are bioengineered and delivered to the masses.  
	- The Board of the Zion Corporation are made the first flesh warpers and the first clergy of this new religion.
- The Anunnaki send a messenger ship on the long voyage through the portal on Saturn to inform the Pattern of the begun reawakening of the Fleshwarper.  They are not expected to hear a response for several hundred years.  In the meantime they continue to monitor and manipulate the situation where they can.
## The Restoration
- The period while the dome remains closed over Zion has become known as the restoration.  
	- This period lasts for ~4 generations (400 year give or take) long enough for myths to form in and outside the dome.  
- ~2 years after the dome (ATD) closes humans outside of Zion begin to birth the first mutants.  It is assumed this is an unforeseen side effect of the radioactive fall out, but it's due to the manipulations of the Diminished One.  
	- Humans probably were awful to their mutant children at first.  many were probably killed shortly after birth until it became obvious the problem wasn't going away.
- ~3-4 years ATD Demons are thriving in the areas covered by the Flesh during the CEO's Apotheosis.  The sky around these areas bein to warp and change turning green as the atmosphere shifts to favor that of the Flesh.  Winds begin blowing Chlorine Storms about, deadly to non-mutants and highly oxidizing to metal, these storms are usually preceded by the sky turning Green before a thick burning mist rolls in.  **we need a colloquial name for these storms**  
- There are early attempts at reestablishing the US Government and old Cities or States as well, but they all fail to war or rebellion. Eventually new Cities, and sometime city-states will rise and fall during this time period. Some of the larger Cities doe have some longer term success where infrastructure was still mostly intact.
	- Cities closest to Demon Fields tend to be overrun by demons
	- Its not unheard of for a thriving City to get hit with a bad fall out or chlorine storm wiping it out or severely setting back any progress
	- The world had become mostly reliant on LN products prior to the Revelation, so not having ready access to new sources (while LN power is long lasting it is still very finite outside of Zion) while the dome is closed causes lots of problems, some of the settlements are able to make use of other sources of power (dams, wind, etc.)  but these tend to be especially susceptible to the storms.
	- Inter-settlement wars, and large bandit groups also serve to stagnate technological advances and slow the reformation of a united society outside of Zion as well.
	- The Waste land is basically stuck in a old west kind of era with some pockets of more advanced civilization and tech here and there.
- ~10-25 years ATD the Anunnaki firm up their foot hold on several of their key establishment in the American waste. UFO town (formerly Roswell NM), The Area (formerly Area 51), New Sherman (formerly Skinwalker Ranch/Ballard Utah) Cemetery (formerly Aurora Texas, named for the cemetery where the Anunnaki pilot was buried in 1896)  These become the most stable settlements over this time period due to the influence of the Anunnaki.
	- Cemetery in particular is built up rather early due to its proximity to Austin/Zion  and is the main watch post for the dome.
## The Empire of Zion
- Year 1 AR (**AR perhaps? for After Restoration?** YES)The meat dome reopens over Austin, TX  
	- The City, now known as Zion, sets about expanding their reach in the wastelands.
	- Each house sends representatives out into the wastes in order to establish [[05 places/franchise locations of the empire of zion\|franchises]]
- 4 AR Jericho is established on what remains of the San Antonio, TX becoming the military hub of the Corporate Empire of Zion
- The Prodigy initiative is started and the first Garden is created near to a Demon Field in former Las Vegas.
